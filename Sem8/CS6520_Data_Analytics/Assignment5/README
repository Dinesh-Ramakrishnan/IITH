This assignment contains: Assign5_knn.R and Assign5_logistic_regression.R 

Assign5_knn.R is the k-nearest neighbor approach to solve the classification problem with which I am getting 77% accuracy. On the other hand, Assign5_logistic_regression.R contains logistic regression approach to solve the classification problem with which I get 51.33% accuracy. Hence, k nearest neighbor approach works better.
