In this regard it is submitted that due to the demolition drive undertaken on Puttenahalli main road, the traffic had to be diverted towards 24th main and this had resulted in slow movement of traffic on this stretch.  how ever, presently normal traffic movement on puttenahalli main has been restored and traffic flow is normal.  A lady homeguard will be positioned at the said road everyday.

The officer will accept the compounding amount in cash and printed receipt of the payment containing all the details will be given to the person upon signing the receipt. Henceforth, the pending notices can be compounded with any Challaning Officer of Delhi Traffic Police at anytime and anywhere in Delhi on all seven days of the week.

 The factors causing road rage vary from increasing number of vehicles jostling for the limited road space, rising stress levels and decreasing tolerance of drivers, inflated egos, influence of alcohol and the hot and unmerciful weather conditions which may aggravate the stress levels.  Road Rage engulfs a driver without warning, and tends to destabilize a person that it makes him/her irrationally impulsive, to do things they normally would not like to do chasing, abusing, running down, hurting, bashing, at times even killing.  

 Educating commuters through various means is an effective way to tackle the incidents of road rage. Similarly, the police officers/men who are , when a scuffle or argument starts, may also immediately intervene so that it may not lead to a big incident. The commuters/motorists may follow the following habits/practice to prevent road rage while commuting on Delhi roads:- 

i) Never indulge in scuffle/argument as it may it lead to a big incident. Be polite and kind. 
ii) Respect right of way of other road users.
iii) Keep yourself behind the wheel. Affixing photos of your loved ones on dashboards may also be helpful in preventing road rage.
iv) Adopt good driving practice such as do not drink & drive, do not honk, , do not use mobile phone while driving, follow discipline etc. etc.
v) Being late makes you anxious and impatient so allow yourself plenty of time to reach your destination in time. Allotting even 10 extra minutes for your trip will allow you to handle unexpected delays calmly.
vi) Find alternative route if your regular route is congested which makes you sometimes anxious.
vii) Listening to relaxing music while driving is also helpful to keep yourself calm from the traffic chaos.
viii) If you find yourself unable to control your rage/anger, consult a physician/ Psychiatrists
ix) Take assistance of nearby traffic police personnel or local police personnel, PCR staff etc., if needed.
x) In case of any police help please call on 100 or 1095. Complaints can also be sent on Whatsapp. 
xi) In addition, always keep a cool head, avoid eye contact, never make obscene gestures, do not use your vehicle to intimidate others, do not become frustrated or stressed out—if you do, remove yourself from the situation, never get behind the wheel if you are tired or irritable and avoid confrontation

Driving in a lane is sane driving. Driving in proper lane facilitate traffic to move smoothly. When traffic flows smoothly, there is less tailgating, less weaving in-and-out of traffic, and therefore fewer road accidents. Unwarranted changing of lane disturbs the traffic and rhythm of a driver and the tendency to lose control increases, which some time can be fatal. Lane courtesy promotes the smooth flow of traffic and helps drivers maintain an even pace. When traffic is flowing smoothly, road capacity is utilized to the fullest extent thereby ensuring uninterrupted flow of traffic.

Traffic lane lines are broken lines which permit lane changing with caution. Similarly, bus lane is a continuous white line painted on the road on extreme left lane which is to be only used by buses, heavy goods vehicles, medium goods vehicles and four wheeled light goods vehicles. Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in CWP No. 13029/85 – M.C. Mehta Vs. UOI & Ors. has directed that these vehicles shall be confined to the bus lane and equally no other motorized vehicle is permitted to enter upon the bus lane. As a part of lane driving on Delhi roads by other transport vehicles, the Delhi Traffic Police under the provisions of Rule 22 of Rules of Road Regulation, 1989 read with Rule 111 of Delhi Motor Vehicles Rules, 1993 vide Notification No. 7500-7650/TE(D-II)/Traffic dated 18.6.2010 has further designated the following pattern of lanes for plying of light four wheeled and three wheeled light goods vehicles: -

1. Extreme left lane i.e. Bus Lane for the plying of light four wheeled transport vehicles such as Omni Cargo, Mahindra Pick-up, Taxi, Tourist Taxi, Motor Cabs, RTV etc. on all roads having six lanes with or without a provision of central median.
2. Middle lane or 2nd lane i.e. along the Bus Lane for plying of three wheeled light goods vehicles and TSRs on all six lane roads with or without a provision of central median.
3. Extreme left lane for the plying of light four wheeled transport vehicles such as Omni Cargo, Mahindra Pick Up, Taxi, Tourist Taxi, Motor Cab, RTVs etc. and three wheeled light goods vehicles and TSRs on all four lane roads with or without a provision of central median and where the bus lane has not been segregated/marked.
4. For ensuring regulated movement of light four wheeled and three wheeled transport vehicles and better road discipline on the roads of NCT of Delhi in the interest of safety of all road users, these motor vehicles can change their respective lanes 50 mtrs. before an intersection for purpose of turning.

For motorized traffic other than the transport vehicles both goods and passengers, the extreme right lane on all roads having six or more lanes with provision of central median is generally for fast moving traffic. Wherever permitted, the lane changing from one lane to the other should be undertaken with caution and giving proper signal/indication. However, unwarranted changing of lane should be avoided in the general interest of safety of all road users.

White colour is generally used for carriageway (road) markings. For indicating restrictions yellow markings are also used. On a two way road which is not divided by any central verge/railings/any other means, the centre line separates the streams of traffic coming from opposite directions and facilitate their movement. This line can be crossed if overtaking is essential provided the oncoming carriageway is clear.

The central lines can be: -
i) Single broken line
ii) Single continuous solid line
iii) A double solid line or a combination of solid line and broken line.

Single solid line generally white should not be crossed, however, lane changing is discouraged. Whereas, single solid yellow line which is basically an imaginary central verge, should never be crossed and overtaking is strictly prohibited. 
On a road with two centre solid lines of yellow/white colour, where visibility is restricted in both directions, neither stream of traffic is allowed is to cross the lines. Overtaking is also prohibited in both the directions. Similarly, right turn maneuvers are strictly prohibited.

If the line on the driver’s side is broken, he may cross or straddle it. Overtaking is allowed but only if it is safe to do so. If the line of driver’s side is continuous, he must not cross/overlap it. For Single yellow, driver cannot cross the line except while turning right or taking U turn.

In addition, a stop line is a single solid white line painted across the road before the zebra crossings and intersection. This line indicates that all vehicles must stop before it when signal is red or as directed by traffic police man on duty. In addition, border or edge lines are continuous line at the edge of the road and mark the limits of the main carriageway upto which a driver can safely move.

While changing lanes adequate precautions should be taken. Use of mirrors should be undertaken in right perspective. Traffic moving on the right should be given precedence as it has the right of way.

In order to bring about a visible impact on driver behaviour in the city and ensure lane discipline amongst motorists, the Delhi Traffic Police are laying more emphasis on prosecuting motorists found indulging in improper lane changing, road hogging between the stream of traffic, not driving in the designated lane. 69,544  were prosecuted so far. 

Thus all the motorists are once again requested to adhere to the traffic rules and regulations in their own interest and in the interest of the safety of other road users to make Delhi roads safer for all concerned.

Driving in a lane is sane driving. Driving in proper lane facilitate traffic to move smoothly. When traffic flows smoothly, there is less tailgating, less weaving in-and-out of traffic, and therefore fewer road accidents. Unwarranted changing of lane disturbs the traffic and rhythm of a driver and the tendency to lose control increases, which some time can be fatal. Lane courtesy promotes the smooth flow of traffic and helps drivers maintain an even pace. When traffic is flowing smoothly, road capacity is utilized to the fullest extent thereby ensuring uninterrupted flow of traffic.

Traffic lane lines are broken lines which permit lane changing with caution. Similarly, bus lane is a continuous white line painted on the road on extreme left lane which is to be only used by buses, heavy goods vehicles, medium goods vehicles and four wheeled light goods vehicles. Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in CWP No. 13029/85 – M.C. Mehta Vs. UOI & Ors. has directed that these vehicles shall be confined to the bus lane and equally no other motorized vehicle is permitted to enter upon the bus lane. As a part of lane driving on Delhi roads by other transport vehicles, the Delhi Traffic Police under the provisions of Rule 22 of Rules of Road Regulation, 1989 read with Rule 111 of Delhi Motor Vehicles Rules, 1993 vide Notification No. 7500-7650/TE(D-II)/Traffic dated 18.6.2010 has further designated the following pattern of lanes for plying of light four wheeled and three wheeled light goods vehicles: -

1. Extreme left lane i.e. Bus Lane for the plying of light four wheeled transport vehicles such as Omni Cargo, Mahindra Pick-up, Taxi, Tourist Taxi, Motor Cabs, RTV etc. on all roads having six lanes with or without a provision of central median.
2. Middle lane or 2nd lane i.e. along the Bus Lane for plying of three wheeled light goods vehicles and TSRs on all six lane roads with or without a provision of central median.
3. Extreme left lane for the plying of light four wheeled transport vehicles such as Omni Cargo, Mahindra Pick Up, Taxi, Tourist Taxi, Motor Cab, RTVs etc. and three wheeled light goods vehicles and TSRs on all four lane roads with or without a provision of central median and where the bus lane has not been segregated/marked.
4. For ensuring regulated movement of light four wheeled and three wheeled transport vehicles and better road discipline on the roads of NCT of Delhi in the interest of safety of all road users, these motor vehicles can change their respective lanes 50 mtrs. before an intersection for purpose of turning.

For motorized traffic other than the transport vehicles both goods and passengers, the extreme right lane on all roads having six or more lanes with provision of central median is generally for fast moving traffic. Wherever permitted, the lane changing from one lane to the other should be undertaken with caution and giving proper signal/indication. However, unwarranted changing of lane should be avoided in the general interest of safety of all road users.

White colour is generally used for carriageway (road) markings. For indicating restrictions yellow markings are also used. On a two way road which is not divided by any central verge/railings/any other means, the centre line separates the streams of traffic coming from opposite directions and facilitate their movement. This line can be crossed if overtaking is essential provided the oncoming carriageway is clear.

The central lines can be: -
i) Single broken line
ii) Single continuous solid line
iii) A double solid line or a combination of solid line and broken line.

Single solid line generally white should not be crossed, however, lane changing is discouraged. Whereas, single solid yellow line which is basically an imaginary central verge, should never be crossed and overtaking is strictly prohibited. 
On a road with two centre solid lines of yellow/white colour, where visibility is restricted in both directions, neither stream of traffic is allowed is to cross the lines. Overtaking is also prohibited in both the directions. Similarly, right turn maneuvers are strictly prohibited.

If the line on the driver’s side is broken, he may cross or straddle it. Overtaking is allowed but only if it is safe to do so. If the line of driver’s side is continuous, he must not cross/overlap it. For Single yellow, driver cannot cross the line except while turning right or taking U turn.

In addition, a stop line is a single solid white line painted across the road before the zebra crossings and intersection. This line indicates that all vehicles must stop before it when signal is red or as directed by traffic police man on duty. In addition, border or edge lines are continuous line at the edge of the road and mark the limits of the main carriageway upto which a driver can safely move.

While changing lanes adequate precautions should be taken. Use of mirrors should be undertaken in right perspective. Traffic moving on the right should be given precedence as it has the right of way.

In order to bring about a visible impact on driver behaviour in the city and ensure lane discipline amongst motorists, the Delhi Traffic Police are laying more emphasis on prosecuting motorists found indulging in improper lane changing, road hogging between the stream of traffic, not driving in the designated lane. 68,182  were prosecuted so far. 

Thus all the motorists are once again requested to adhere to the traffic rules and regulations in their own interest and in the interest of the safety of other road users to make Delhi roads safer for all concerned.
