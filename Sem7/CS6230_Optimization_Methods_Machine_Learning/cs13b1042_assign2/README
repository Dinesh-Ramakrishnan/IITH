Image details

prox_parta.png is the plot of f-f* vs iterations for proximal gradient implementation over 5000 iterations.

accprox_parta.png is the plot of f-f* vs iterations for acc. proximal gradient implementation over 5000 iterations.

Part b) B* has all zeros (there are no non-zero elements) The graph partb.png measures the accuracy for different values of lambda

In part c) -> Since B* matrix is all zeros, we find the predicted class label and check with the ground truth ratings available.

Images -> correct_1.png till correct_5.png are all correctly classified samples, whereas incorrect_1.png till incorrect_5.png are all incorrectly classified samples.
