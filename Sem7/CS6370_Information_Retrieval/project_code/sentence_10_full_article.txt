words kill or give life they are usually either poison or good fruit 
the words we speak are electromagnetic forces that usually reflect our inner attitude 
they contain the power of death and life and ultimately influence the world around us 
augustus woodbury once said scientific men tell us that every sound upon the surface of our own and other planets circulates in endless and ceaseless waves through infinite space 
certainly not less subtle is the influence of our words upon the life and character of the world we must always think about the influence of our words before we say them out what is my objective in saying this are these words going to produce life or death proverbs declares death and life are in the power of the tongue and those who love it will eat its fruit as a matter of fact words are our input in someone else s life 
we must make sure our input gives life and not death 
we are actually responsible for the impact we have on others and our communities in general 
as responsible citizens we must intensify our awareness of the input we have on other people s lives 
actually one person can change the course of another person s life with the power of words 
individual dreams and visions have been aborted because of words of death spoken over them 
homes and marriages have been destroyed because of poisonous words 
companies and businesses have fallen because of words of envy and jealousy 
people have lost their jobs because of lying words said about them 
we should always be conscious of the life changing power of our words 
proverbs says better is a poor person who walks in his integrity than one who is crooked in speech and is a fool we must use wisdom when we speak by checking our motives attitudes and choice of words 
we must divorce negative patterns of thinking and bring life to others with our words 
words are influencers 
one of the best ways we can use words to influence others is to practice telling the truth 
we are living in the world where too often people try to influence others with manipulation false flattery and deception and spin doctoring 
the truth creates trust which in turn generates influence 
the other way we can put our words to good use is to choose to use words that build in our speech rather than words that tear down people and society 
we should use our words to build other people up to inspire encourage and empower to affirm and bless 
positive words yield positive influence 
it is wisdom to refuse to speak words that belittle and demoralise other people around us 
when we make a choice of speaking well of others in spite of their short comings then we will have a healthy and far reaching positive influence with our words 
if we spread malicious gossip we are poisoning our own future and sabotaging our own influence with others 
king solomon of ancient israel said when a leader listens to malicious gossip all the workers get infested with evil proverbs the message bible 
we must use the influence of our words to bring peace in conflicting situations 
due to the fact that many people have no understanding of the power of their words they have caused themselves and others unnecessary pain and hardships 
each and every day our actions and our words impact those around us 
the question is how are we influencing others with our words and actions 
one of the best ways we can influence each other is by inspiring motivating and encouraging each other by what we say 
the story is told about how sugar ray robinson changed the course of one girl s life flo jo 
when narrating her life story flo jo said sugar ray looked at me in the eye and told me it doesn t matter where you come from what the colour of your skin is or what odds are against you 
all that matters is that you have a dream and you commit yourself to that dream 
do that and it will happen she continued and said right then and there i was sold out 
i was just eight years old but i was fired up about what my future could be with words sugar ray robinson one of the outstanding boxing champs inspired a great change in one girls life 
words are powerful they can inspire those around us to greatness 
they can bring hope to the hopeless courage to the discouraged comfort and healing to the oppressed 
we must speak life to our husbands wives children fathers mothers our communities and nation 
paul s wise advice to the ephesians is appropriate at this juncture let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may minister grace to the hearers ephesians 
by our words we can build the nation and by our words we can destroy the nation 
just in time for the holiday shopping seasons apple has announced a series of hardware upgrades for the iphone ipad and apple tv 
iphone s price sees steep increaseall the apple announcements just in time for the holiday shopping season apple has announced a series of hardware upgrades for the iphone ipad and apple tv 
with the iphone the company added a feature called 3d touch which lets users control some of the software by exerting pressure on the touch screen 
the apple tv got its first big upgrade in more than three years with a more powerful chip and a redesigned remote control 
apple s family of ipads also gained a bigger sibling with the ipad pro a tablet with a inch screen much larger than the older inch ipad 
at the event i tried out the new products in a demonstration booth 
here are some first impressions iphone the 3d touch capability is the iphone s signature new feature 
pressing down on the screen starts different actions depending on how much force is exerted 
a light press on an email for example shows a preview of the message and a hard press then opens the email 
you can also press down hard on an app icon to open shortcuts to different actions for example pushing down on the instagram app shows a list of next steps including the ability to create a new post 
when you press down hard the device responds with a tapping sensation 
i found the new iphones pretty straightforward to use 
the 3d touch feature is easy to get used to and i quickly figured out how to create a new calendar appointment by pressing down hard on the calendar app icon 
the new smartphones are also slightly thicker and heavier than their predecessors though i confess i noticed that only after reading the specifications on apple s website and not when holding the devices 
ipad the ipad pro s jumbo screen obviously gives more room for content to breathe but interacting with it still feels the same as with older ipad tablets 
the ipad pro is capable of running two full size ipad apps on the screen at the same time 
the previous ipad air could run two apps at the same time but with a primary app taking up a larger portion of the screen 
the large device will be familiar to most because apart from its size it works the same as previous versions of the tablet 
the big screen ipad also felt comfortable to hold 
it weighs about grams which is the same weight as the very first ipad 
apple tv the apple tv is significantly different from past models 
the software interface has a white background and vivid colours similar to apple s music app 
the new remote control includes a touch pad for scrolling around the menu and a microphone for finding things to watch using siri apple s voice assistant 
the remote also includes motion sensors for gaming 
i decided to have some fun by asking siri to help me navigate content on apple tv 
for example i tried using siri to steer a spaceship in a star wars game 
but that was difficult perhaps because of my inexperience with the game 
i also tried searching for action movies and comedy movies with the remote control s microphone 
siri misunderstood me when i said comedy thinking i had said comity 
but it did a better job with action movies when i said show me action movies siri brought up a list of titles including mad max and furious 
the new remote control is thicker than the previous one and in this case that s a good thing 
the previous apple tv remote was so thin that it had a tendency to disappear between couch cushions

tony abbott s last word watch the last press conference of outgoing prime minister tony abbott in full 
pt6m11s they re the power couple who have run the liberal party back room operation since december 
but tony abbott s ousting as prime minister will inevitably lead to his high profile chief of staff peta credlin quitting the blue carpet in parliament house s ministerial wing 
peta credlin and brian loughnane arrive for the midwinter ball at parliament house in june 
photo alex ellinghausen what will happen to her husband long serving liberal party federal director brian loughnane is less clear 
ms credlin worked for malcolm turnbull during his stint as opposition leader in but the pair did not always see eye to eye and she will not be working for the incoming leader 
after her time with mr turnbull ms credlin became the dominant figure in the abbott government described as a controlling co prime minister by her critics lauded by her allies not least mr abbott who called her the fiercest political warrior i ve ever worked with 
as chief of staff she became one of the most high profile staffers in recent political history 
from the first days of the abbott opposition in december peta credlin was in the room as one of his most trusted lieutenants 
photo alex ellinghausen from the first days of the abbott opposition in december ms credlin was in the room as one of the opposition leader s most trusted lieutenants alongside press secretaries and advisers andrew hirst and claire kimball honing and refining mr abbott s laser like attack on kevin rudd s carbon pollution reduction scheme 
after just less than four years in opposition in september ms credlin a lawyer with years of experience in the howard government made the transition as chief of staff into government 
but the tightly controlled approach adopted in opposition did not work as smoothly in government 
mr abbott and ms credlin in 
photo alex ellinghausen public complaints about a command and control approach taken by the prime minister s office quickly surfaced and a reliance on slogans that worked in opposition did not cut through in government 
in february when mr abbott faced a spill motion in the party room some mps were calling for a shake up of the prime minister s office and for political veteran tony nutt to be brought into the office 
ms credlin disappeared from public view for a time but the complaints soon resurfaced 
brian loughnane has been federal director of the liberal party since 
photo alex ellinghausen but mr abbott refused suggestions of change to his office in his farewell speech he singled out his chief of staff who has been unfairly maligned by people who should ve known better 
and now both exit the political centre stage at least for a time 
mr loughnane meanwhile has been federal director of the liberal party since february and party strategists told fairfax media on tuesday that if possible he should continue in the role 
one veteran pointed out that mr turnbull and mr loughnane had worked together before during mr turnbull s stint as opposition leader and that a change in director was not necessary or inevitable 
that veteran also said the prime minister s office would likely benefit from a bit of competitive tension between it and liberal party hq 
it depends on the relationship between the two of them mr loughnane has served every leader since howard 
but malcolm will have to be comfortable with the director you can t have a situation like former prime minister paul keating and former alp secretary gary gray in 
a second liberal veteran said ms credlin was very talented and a good manager but it will be hard for her to stay in the show 
i do hope brian stays on 
the most important thing is corporate knowledge and experience 
fairfax media sought comment from ms credlin and mr loughnane 
on tuesday mr turnbull also began the process of putting together his office team 
the former secretary of the department of resources energy and tourism and of the communications department drew clarke will serve as his acting chief of staff while mr nutt who worked closely with turnbull backer senator arthur sinodinos in the office of john howard will return to canberra to help manage the transition to the prime ministership 
senator sinodinos confirmed on tuesday that mr turnbull would seek to emulate the attitude of mr howard as prime minister by taking a team approach and have a number of senior people in there who can provide advice and make sure it s an open prime minister s office it s accessible and that there are tributaries of advice going to the prime minister he told sky news 
the role of the office is not to be a gatekeeper and cut people off the role of the office has to be a facilitator of contact so the prime minister knows and has early warning of whether there are concerns 
you don t need the polls if you have backbenchers who are frank and willing to tell you what is going on

alright alright alright the time is now for us to put down our thoughts and predictions about our opening game against the youngstown state university penguins 
a lot of newcomers have joined this blog since the end of last season so thanks to you guys for coming onboard and please don t hesitate to join in 
onto the main stage event 
as i write this it s hours to game time and maybe hours or so to meet up with old friends and make new ones while we talk about the present past and future of the football program and in particular this team 
we all know about the rather dramatic changes the program and the athletic department have gone through since dec th when paul chryst left for wisconsin and when our new beloved leader chancellor mark gallagher dropped the ax on the neck of ad steve pederson s tenure at pitt 
that has discussed over and overt and now its time to move on to real football 
with that here is your chance to give the world your pitt vs 
ysu game predictions 
please add your thoughts on why you feel your prediction will come true and if you feel like it throw in some individual player s work that you think will make it happen 
i m asking for your thoughts so i ll start off with mine in my season prediction article i wrote about the reasons i have some trepidation regarding our new head coach pat narduzzi s debut and how it will affect the players on field play and the coaching staff s in game coaching in determining the outcome of the match 
i m not sold that narduzzi is going to be able to go head to head this early in his career with a good successful and well established ysu head coach bo pelini and win the game in a fashion most pitt fans have been assuming will happen which would be a blow out pitt win 
that may not be a concern for me after the iowa game especially if we do well in those two games 
but right now there has to be a lot of wondering in the clubhouse and the coaches offices as to what product we ll put out on the field of play 
that said we have talented football players some extremely so on offense who should be able to play through any worries they themselves may have and through any poor in game decisions by the staff and there will be a few 
if our incumbent qb takes the reins right out of the gate and shows true leadership of the offense then i ll feel better about the outcome 
however as our commenter still the one pointed out in his comments wednesday narduzzi and chaney are looking for a good performance from transfer qb nate peterman early on in the game 
i don t believe it will be a wait until we are a huge lead ahead or big deficit behind to play the backup qb situation but that the staff has real need for them to see peterman playing actual football against an opponent 
we ll discuss the outcome of that move on sunday i m sure 
however just the offense picking up where it left off and actually i don t think it will especially with the jerry rigged offensive line and the uncertainty at wr doesn t guarantee us a win 
the defense has to be there in even better form than the offense to get a win 
i believe our defense is still in a state of instability and is going to be changing on the fly during this game and week to week for a few games 
as i ve said before i think narduzzi and conklin s plan for single coverage by the cornerbacks is a problem waiting to show its face at least in this first game 
here is what i think after reading writing and digesting all the pitt footballs news notes and opinions since pat narduzzi signed on the dotted line reed s take the game will close through three quarters with both teams leading at one point 
conner gets less than yards but scores two tds 
passing game will be ok with more use of our tes and peterman will impress in his playing time 
we create turnovers by aggressive defensive play but give up more passing at least one big pass play and rushing yards than we hoped we would 
pitt pulls away in the 4th quarter to win pitt ysu chip in with your thoughts as to what you think we ll see and what the outcome will be 
we ll take a look at our predictions on sunday and talk about the outcome of this important game 
note we didn t get many responses for suggestions on a meeting place for the pre game pitt blather meeting drink bull throwing festivities 
so i m asking you guys to meet at the bettis grill before the game 
i ll be there at around 
i ll try to get there earlier but have a friend s tailgate in red to visit also he owes me so i have to break his kneecap 
after that i ll go over to bettis and then leave around or so for the press box 
i can t wait to see old friends and meet some new blather followers 
again check the picture out on this post i ll be the guy with his head above almost everyone else s a blue polo shirt with blather on it and longer hair and a dw style mustache

official says small number of benghazi related emails by updated 51pm copyright cable news network turner broadcasting system inc 
all rights reserved 
this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed 
an email chain between former secretary of state hillary clinton and then commander of u s 
central command david petraeus from january and february is raising questions about whether some of the emails on clinton s private email server were mistakenly deemed personal and not included among the pages of emails she turned over to the state department 
separately on friday a state department official said a small number of benghazi related emails that had not been disclosed to the house committee investigating the terror attack had been discovered 
in the past few days the state department was contacted by the department of defense about the clinton petraeus chain two state department officials said 
the officials say the chain does not appear to include classified information though an official determination has not been made 
the chain included clinton and petraeus getting acquainted as well as some personnel matters according to the officials 
it was apparently considered personal by clinton s team and therefore wasn t turned over to the state department the officials said 
most of the email chain was on an old email server clinton says she no longer has access to but the end of the email chain contained messages on the private server she used while in office according to another official 
the chain begins on january and ends on feb 
and contains less than emails total between clinton and petraeus the official said 
state department spokesman john kirby said state received several copies of one email chain between former secretary clinton and then commander of u s 
central command david petraeus which were not previously in the possession of the department from the department of defense and the state inspector general 
these emails are now in our possession and will be subject to freedom of information act requests 
furthermore we asked the ig to incorporate this matter into the review secretary kerry requested in march 
we have also informed congress of this matter 
also on friday a state department official also told cnn that in the process of turning over libya related emails to the select committee on benghazi it found a small number of benghazi related emails that had not been disclosed to the committee previously 
these emails are among libya related emails being turned over friday and were found within the emails clinton turned over to the state department from her private server 
the official said the emails were found because they have now been digitized and are easier to search 
clinton turned over to state her work related emails from the server and kept emails she deemed personal 
the email server has since been turned over to the fbi where investigators have been able to recover both the personal and work related emails 
the fbi is looking into whether any classified materials were mishandled

the texas state football team scored points in its home opener 
here s the five key plays from the win 

a new school record prairie view a m was trailing with a couple seconds remaining in the first quarter facing a 3rd and on texas state s yard line 
the panthers punted in order to pin the bobcats in their own territory but their plan was foiled by brandon mcdowell sophomore cornerback 
mcdowell fielded the punt and found some space to make a play 
the sophomore ran past a couple of panthers and all of a sudden a lane opened up for him 
mcdowell broke some tackles and ankles and took the punt across the field for a yard punt return for a touchdown 
mcdowell is behind brandon smith senior wide receiver for punt returns but after a return like this smith might be looking over his shoulder 

second chance it took seconds for texas state to get on the board 
another touchdown followed less than two minutes later 
the opportunity was created because damani alexcee junior safety forced a fumble that trey mcgowan senior linebacker recovered at texas state s yard line 
the fumble recovery opened up the game entirely by gifting another possession to the bobcats 

back on track robert lowe senior running back scored the first touchdown of the game with remaining in the first quarter 
the touchdown was set up by a yard completion to jafus gains senior wide receiver that put the team on the five yard line 
this drive set the tone for the rest of the game as texas state showed their dominance all night over prairie view a m 
lowe rushed to the left side with ease and gave texas state a lead 

bowling ball on third 3rd and in the redzone texas state went to chris nutall senior running back 
nutall did enough to get the first down but he found more running room and took his carry into the end zone for six points 
nutall s score gave texas state a lead with left in the first quarter 
all hopes of an upset for prairie view a m were diminishing after the score 
the drive was the bobcats second of the game and their high powered offense was on display early on in the game 

going long the play started off looking like an option play with tyler jones junior quarterback but he pulled back from the option 
smith was wide open in the secondary 
the senior wide receiver hauled in the pass from jones and the panthers secondary was nowhere in sight 
smith took the catch for a yard touchdown 
the touchdown gave the team a lead in the game 
it was the first of three passing touchdowns for jones

listening to politicians campaigning you a picture you get is that after october tanzanians will be living in heaven 
candidates promises paints a flawless tanzania in which no one will labour for anything 
if you critically look at things which politicians in the campaign trail promise they are going to accomplish if elected you will be petrified 
anyone with sober mind will be horrified and left wondering on how and when these politicians are going to fulfil these pledges 
it seems also that even those who are defending their seats have forgotten that in they issued a lot of promises majority of which they have not accomplished 
they now go out to dish out even more promises 
while mwalimu nyerere used to tell tanzanians that they will develop only through hard work our candidates are competing to show that they have solutions to all problems and these solutions do not entail people working let alone working hard to resolve their problems 
candidates are promising each and everything but none of them have been heard telling tanzanians that they will have to toil for them to earn their daily bread 
making promises to the effect that people will not be required to work in order to better their lives amounts to making them complacent 
and this will not only affect the individuals but the entire nation 
for the nation to make strides it needs hard working people who will be able to first change their personal lives and then contribute for the national economy 
crave for victory should not blind the candidates and push them to give promises which in actual fact are not reasonable 
we should only look back into and take stock of what was promised and what has been accomplished for us to be able to gauge what promising mean to the individuals and the nation 
the promises we have been hearing would need a lot of money to be implemented 
but we are not told where this money will come from 
other candidates have started to cite natural gas as one source of money with which they will accomplish their promises 
but we know that a better expert s guess is that the next leadership will leave the office before the country starts to see real money from the natural gas 
so there is no point in cheating the public that gas will provide enough money for implementation of these many plans which we are hearing 
politicians should campaign knowing that this country or its people are not going to end tomorrow 
they should practice considerate politics which respect the fact that cheating would only give them satisfaction but subject the country and its people to pointless argony
