the fifth season of hbo s game of thrones made history at the emmy awards on sunday when it became the first sci fi or fantasy show ever to win best drama and its total awards broke the record for the most won by any show in a single year 
yet some have griped that even if game of thrones is a great show this wasn t its best season 
indeed that this may even have been its worst season 
season was almost certainly its most controversial season especially because of the spoiler alert the marital rape of sansa stark in episode and the sacrificial burning of shireen baratheon in episode neither of which has yet happened in george r r 
martin s novels 
some of the show s creatives including the director of episode have addressed these controversies in the past 
but evidently game of thrones creators dan benioff and d b 
weiss still feel the issue is unresolved 
in a post emmy interview with entertainment weekly benioff said that they never set out to offend anyone by staging those brutal moments 
to try to offend anyone would be juvenile but to be afraid to offend people would be cowardly benioff explained 
there were people saying they were never going to watch again 
we re just trying to tell the story the best we can 
it was certainly good enough for emmy voters 
and for quite a few viewers at home as well

rocker ryan adams said covering taylor swift s entire album was incredibly humbling and helped him explore himself more deeply as a musician 
adams version of was digitally released monday 
swift released the original album her first full blown pop record last october

it felt no less genuine than any song i ve ever written for myself 
so far swift s fifth album has sold million units and launched multiple hits including no 1s like shake it off blank space and bad blood 
adams interpretation of offers a slowed down take on her upbeat anthems 
i got to work different parts of my brain different parts of my heart and different parts of the musical aspects of my personality adams said of covering swift s music 
it s really its own thing 
it s not the same record 
after completing his version the singer songwriter producer played it for year old swift before taking it any further 
he namedropped bob mould as one his favorite musicians but added in the same breath but then i also love all those songs on swift s fearless album 
i don t really have a place where my music begins and ends 
adams said he has known swift for about years and counts himself as a fan 
adams released his debut album heartbreaker in 
his self titled record his 14th studio release earned him two grammy nominations earlier this year including best rock album 
he has also found success as a producer for acts like willie nelson and jenny lewis

i was already collecting albums 
by i was skateboarding i had gotten my first guitar he said 
i had my first record player and i remember i got my first couple of real albums that were my own records and i was really excited about them

west brom have rejected a third bid from tottenham for saido berahino press association sport understands 
the offer which arrived late on tuesday was only marginally better than spurs previous bid which would have only risen to 21million with clauses and add ons 
the baggies have instantly dismissed tottenham s third approach and remain determined to keep the england under striker at the hawthorns 
berahino had a transfer request rejected last month with albion angered by tottenham s continued pursuit of the year old 
the baggies are understood to be unhappy with spurs approach to the deal which has only strengthened their resolve to keep berahino 
the forward has been left out of west brom s last three squads during the speculation with boss tony pulis insisting he was not in the right state of mind to play 
share article spurs have been searching for more firepower to help harry kane and despite signing son heung min from bayer leverkusen maintained their interest in berahino 
he scored goals last season and earned a call up to the england senior squad but missed euro for the under 21s with a knee injury

the dollar may be down but that doesn t mean packing away the passport permanently 
in fact new research expedia value tracker reveals the best value spots for a christmas trip overseas and even the us figures as a possibility 
that s because currency fluctuations are not the only monetary movement to factor in 
changes in accommodation flight and living costs all contribute to the value of a holiday 
for instance new zealand is the only destination where the australian dollar currently goes further than it did a year ago up four per cent year on year 
but the average accommodation cost there has risen nine per cent while average flight prices between nz and australia have decreased five per cent 
that all adds up to expedia considering new zealand the best value option for aussies right now 
as for the us the fact that flight costs have dipped per cent in the past year offsets the dollar drop of per cent and counting a little 
expedia says travellers might find better value across the border in canada this year where the australian dollar has only fallen six per cent against the canadian dollar and flights decreased by six per cent year on year 
that s especially relevant for those considering a christmas ski break 
expedia australia and nz managing director md george ruebensal suggests however you think creatively 
if travellers are flexible about where they go there are opportunities to save 
and when thinking about europe that s exciting as there are so many amazing places to explore 
for instance why not consider norway where the aussie dollar has gained ground against the norwegian krone and average hotel and flight prices have also decreased 
the aussie has also gained more than per cent against the russian ruble

the story first appeared on the sydney morning herald 
new york time and time again serena williams escaped during this grand slam season on her quest to sweep all four majors 
but finally on friday she hit a roadblock that caused her not just to trip but to fall 
that hurdle came in the most unlikely of forms in roberta vinci a year old world no 
who was making her debut appearance in a grand slam semifinal 
it also came in the form of unthinkable pressure loaded onto the shoulders of the year old world no 
who was trying to sweep all four majors in a calendar year for the first time since when steffi graf did so 
i don t think we can understand the scale of what she felt said leif shiras a tv commentator for british broadcaster sky sports and former player in an interview 
it s tough to play against history 
you have to feel like her loss is a symptom of that pressure 
williams swatted away any suggestion that her friday demise after grand slam match wins this year and dating to wimbledon last season was due to expectation of the moment 
i told you guys i don t feel pressure a tired williams told reporters in a news conference 
i never felt pressure 
i never felt that pressure to win here 
i said that from the beginning 
from the beginning of however williams drive for the grand slam has been a fragile bumpy one 
at the french open she worked through five three setters the most of any major in her career at wimbledon she trailed heather watson by two breaks in the third set in the third round a week ago bethanie mattek sands had her on the ropes in a night match 
each time a serena w but not today 
today was not a good day her coach patrick mouratoglou told a small group of reporters saying williams woke up feeling off 
players are humans he continued 
how many times did it happen this year where she felt like this and she still found her way through 
she didn t find her way today 
even vinci undone by williams four times all in straight sets coming in could see the most feared opponent in tennis looking tentative double faulting yelling at herself to find a way 
in my mind i say think about this she s nervous a smiling vinci said 
so i tried to keep fighting for every single point 
it was apparent to all of us who have watched her for years that she was nervous today chris evert said plainly on espn 
it was a different kind of match than most of her three setters at the majors however 
seven times she had come back from dropping the first set 
but only once in a three set match did she drop the second as she did friday and then right herself 
in the third set against vinci williams appeared lost and at times confounded however 
she barked at herself at one moment all of arthur ashe yelling shouts of encouragement 
the next she was quieting herself palm towards the ground trying to stay calm 
i was just trying to win points at that point and win the match she explained 
one shouldn t underestimate the emotional impact of the slam shiras said 
the toll of this journey she was on was too much for her today shiras said 
she was trying to dig deep and the way to generate energy for her is to get that passion out 
but i think that can tire her there is an element of fatigue that plays into this story 
she was at a breaking point she was boiling 
and vinci was drawing that out of her 
it was amazing drama 
the pressure finally got to serena williams and killed her grand slam dream drama with a twist on this day the time major champion chasing history in front of a home crowd with more power on her racket than anyone in the game was on the losing end 
a defeat with a capital d 
every loss is difficult mouratoglou said 
i think she lost her way mentally 
tactically she didn t know what to do 
when you make the wrong choices you lose the points you re supposed to win and then you make more and more wrong choices 
she lost her way on the path tactically 
a road that started in melbourne ends in new york and not in the way williams imagined

leigh s hopes of promotion to the super league were dented with a defeat to halifax 
paul rowley s team was stunned by their second tier rivals upsetting the form book to register their opening qualifying victory 
leigh had beaten their shay hosts on both previous meetings this year but found themselves down at half time 
facing their most important minutes of the year the visitors made an encouraging start to the second period 
adam higson and fuifui moimoi touched down within nine minutes of the re start to reduce their arrears to just eight points 
but that was close as leigh came to following up last week s encouraging victory over sheffield eagles 
halifax steadied their nerves to put the game out of reach with tries from scott murrell and ste tyrer 
share article ex st helens prospect tyrer finished the game with points adding seven goals to his 60th minute touch down 
dane manning ross divorty and james saltonstall crossed for halifax s remaining tries 
leigh s route to the top flight now looks limited to a winner takes all clash between the fourth and fifth placed teams

the federal government s decision to accept syrian refugees into australia is a start according to the convenor of amnesty international s mudgee branch heather drew 
the federal government s decision to accept syrian refugees into australia is a start according to the convenor of amnesty international s mudgee branch heather drew 
ms drew said amnesty was pleased the australian government has decided to take in some of the millions of syrian s unable to return home especially considering how desperate the situation is getting 
it s a start really ms drew said 
the number of syrian people who are no longer able to return to their own country is in its millions and all of these people are desperate to make a new home for themselves 
we ve agreed to take but the government may need to think about agreeing to take more ms drew said while some people had made suggestions that the number was too high germany had agreed to house refugees that made their way to europe 
twelve thousand people sounds wonderful in comparison to the number australia agreed to take a year ago but compared to the total number of people who need help maybe the government will need to look at the figures again ms drew said 
ms drew said there are around four million syrian refugees registered with humanitarian groups

it is hardly humble or peaceful but it is home for malcolm turnbull 
inside malcolm turnbull s point piper pad it is hardly humble or peaceful but it is home for malcolm turnbull 
the new prime minister says he will not be moving to kirribilli house but is staying put at his red clay coloured home in point piper with its own fetching harbour views 
two days after his swearing in ceremony last monday a big yellow crane appeared behind his house for building work at a neighbouring property 
there are at least five major construction and renovation projects underway in the neighbourhood which comes to life in the early morning hours with the arrival of tradesmen in orange tops and fluorescent green socks tucked inside work boots 
the constant hum of the towering crane that swings large skips full of boulders precariously close to the turnbull rooftop is punctuated by loud beeping and a cacophony of roaring saws drills and cement mixers 
two australian federal police officers sit quietly inside a grey car parked outside the residence 
but they have not gone unnoticed by neighbours who have few complaints about the heightened security presence 
bernice belnick welcomed her neighbour s decision to stay 
i ve been boasting i ve got a pm in my street she says 
i m happy for him to stay 
another neighbour who did not wish to be named said he s got a great house 
it s close to the city 
why should he move 
i think it s important that they live normally 
we often see lucy turnbull walking the dogs in the morning 
further down the road where white washed walls are draped in red bougainvillea and black porche boxters sit in driveways caryl heilig and belinda goldman take time out of their morning walk to share their approval 
i have no problem with malcolm staying in the area ms goldman said 
it think that it s great he has chosen to stay in his home 
we are very happy that he ll be part of the eastern suburbs where we live 
ms heilig agreed it was fantastic the turnbulls had decided to stay in the area 
they may just put a bit more security around the house for him she said 
jennifer coyle who moved from the us to a nearby house two months ago said she was surprised a prime minister would live in the local neighbourhood 
but we find it very refreshing that he has decided to stay in the local community she said 
the police presence makes her feel a bit safer in the home but it is also a little disconcerting that they are around the corner 
ms coyle who works for macquarie bank said she could not imagine an american president living in her street 
i think they would be so frightened for their security that they would be out of the limelight as much as possible she said 
it s really nice to see he turnbull is out in the open 
we saw him walking in the neighbourhood over the weekend 
so it s really good to see he s part of the people 
andrew muston who has lived in the area for years said it was clear to him why mr turnbull wanted to stay 
i don t know why he would want to leave 
it s a pretty nice set up that he s got 
mr muston who graduated from the university of sydney last year with an economics and finance degree jokes that the decision poses one problem 
the only issue is we have a couple of house parties so i was hoping that maybe he might move away and there would be no more noise complaints he said 
no he s a good neighbour 
i ve lived next to him my whole life 
he s a good man 
when in canberra mr turnbull will live at the lodge which has undergone million worth of renovations 
the work is expected to be completed by the end of the year

uk based discount chain poundworld posted record annual sales today 
the company said that it plans to continue its rapid expansion by opening new stores a year from next year 
the uk s second largest single price discount retailer behind poundland said sales jumped to 3m in the months to the end of march in a period when it opened stores with like for like sales up 
the group added that operating profits also hit a record more than doubling by to 6m 
us buyout group tpg took a majority stake in the business for 150m in may in a deal which saw founder and chief executive chris edwards become a multimillionaire 
mr edwards founded the business from a market stall in wakefield in 
poundworld said as a result of new funding from tpg it will accelerate its store expansion programme to in excess of stores a year from onwards 
mr edwards said we have seen a record financial year and one of landmark progress for the company he added that he expected the year ahead to be one of development and consolidation mr edwards said the firm would invest in a new square foot warehouse next to its normanton head office in west yorkshire and replace its it ordering systems 
he said these changes will provide a strong platform for rapid growth over the next three years the group added that its multi price discount chain bargain buy which trades from more than outlets saw like for like sales lift by over the year 
larger rival poundland which owns around stores is in the middle of a 55m acquisition of rival 99p stores 
the takeover was last month provisionally cleared by the uk s competition and markets authority 
supporters of secessionist group junts pel si celebrate after polls closed in a regional parliamentary election in barcelona that saw separatists win a clear majority of seats in catalonia s parliament 
separatists have won a clear majority of seats in catalonia s parliament an exit poll showed on sunday in an election that could set the region on a collision course with spain s central government over independence 
the main secessionist group junts pel si together for yes would get between and seats in the strong assembly while smaller leftist party cup would secure another to seats according to the poll released by local broadcaster tv3 the largest carried out 
they would jointly obtain per cent of the vote amid a an expected record turnout in what would be a big boost to a secession campaign which has been losing support over the last two years 
junts pel si and cup had said before the vote that such a result would allow them to unilaterally declare independence within months under a plan that would see the new catalan authorities approving their own constitution and building institutions like an army central bank and judicial system 
the spanish centre right government of prime minister mariano rajoy which has opposed attempts to hold a referendum on secession has called the breakaway plan a nonsense and vowed to block it in court 
spain s constitution does not allow any region to break away 
catalan secession remains highly hypothetical but the strong pro independence showing is a blow for rajoy less than three months before a countrywide election 
it also creates additional uncertainty over potential talks over a more favourable tax regime and laws that better protect language and culture which analysts say are needed to soothe catalan discontent 
many of the million voters had said on sunday that they did not believe catalonia would become independent and had used their ballot as a way to press the catalan and spanish authorities to discuss those issues

auckland news net thursday 17th september u s 
ambassador to india richard verma has said that the developments of the past year show that india is determined to emerge from its slumber as the second sleeping giant of asia and reclaim its historical position as one of the great world powers 
indian leaders have expressed a determination to leave behind the traditions of non alignment and strategic autonomy and in the words of foreign secretary jaishankar to become a leading power he added 
verma said the strategic partnership between india and the us will be unlike the geo political alliances of the 20th century 
rather than remaining confined to one corner of our planet we will work to uphold the global systems and spaces that will allow for the continued advancement of humankind 
in the words of prime minister modi the great promise of the u s india relationship is what both countries can do together for the world 
to be sure the u s india strategic partnership will be anchored in asia said verma 
but it will also be a truly 21st century relationship of natural allies working together in cyberspace global hotspots outer space the human genome and the global biome he added 
asserting that india is seeking to make up for lost time the us envoy said india is still grappling with a legacy of systemic economic challenges that have hampered its growth in comparison to other asian powers in the 20th century 
however india has exerted a profound historical impact on the global economy and is poised to do so again 
for much of recorded history until the 18th century in fact india s gdp matched or exceeded that of china and dwarfed production in europe said verma 
as the birthplace of buddhism and a historical center of sufi islam india s cultural influence extends from southeast asia to mongolia and from indonesia to the steppes of central asia he added 
the us envoy said the relationship between new delhi and washington will serve as an important new buttress safeguarding open commerce and freedom of navigation in the asia pacific region 
through dialogues such as the u s india east asia consultations which the east west center graciously hosted in june and the u s india japan trilateral dialogue we are working together to promote a democratic and rules based vision for political and economic security in asia said verma in his remarks on an alliance for global prosperity at ewc hawaii 
but our bilateral relationship will be much more far reaching 
the u s 
and indian governments are engaging agricultural professionals from kenya malawi and liberia to improve food security in their countries by increasing crop yields using new technologies he added 
the us envoy said india s generic pharmaceutical industry and highly skilled biotechnology workforce will be essential to addressing the greatest health challenges in all countries across the economic spectrum 
our countries are exchanging findings from current mars missions and are sharing ideas about future explorations 
prime minister modi recently hosted the third usaid supported call to action summit to end preventable maternal and child deaths said verma 
the united states and india have joined forces to advance a multi stakeholder model of internet governance and are working to bring together industry academia and regulators in both our countries in support of this vision 
these are just a few examples that show how the scope of our alliance will not limited by geography or sector but will encompass the full spectrum of human endeavor he added 
verma said as the indian governments have come and gone the ideal of a multiethnic democracy has remained at the very core of the national consciousness 
in this way india was perhaps the first truly 21st century country 
in the decades after the freedom riders who were trained in gandhi s ideals and methods and in some cases in india by gandhi s associates themselves helped the united states begin to come to terms with our own history of injustice providing the reconciliation that allowed for our post cold war prosperity and influence he added 
verma said the commitment to a democratic system and the rule of law that have made india an island of stability in a continent that has seen tremendous upheaval in the past years will continue to provide the indian people the platform on which to construct their 21st century emergence 
that india has lifted millions out of poverty and many of its billion people have prospered while living under a transparent system of government demonstrates that the principles both countries hold dear are not american or asian but human aspirations said verma 
this shared view of a government that is inclusive and accountable to its people has resulted in india despite its considerable economic challenges leading the pack in a number of key indicators 
indian citizens are among the world s most numerous and active social media users much has been written about the indian impact on platforms such as twitter and instagram he added 
the us envoy said the indian innovators are among the most successful and prolific patent applicants in the world and indian companies drawing on a highly educated english speaking workforce are deeply integrated into global business processing 
recent controversies notwithstanding india s civil society is composed of tens of thousands of vocal and active ngos that are influencing policy and budgets around the country 
in this century the advancement of prosperity will require the ability to nurture innovations energize global audiences with new ideas and build cross cultural understanding said verma 
i need only to consider the number of indian citizens using facebook on cell phones charged by village entrepreneurs selling solar power to be certain that india is primed to succeed in these challenges he added

turkey s exports declined by percent to billion in the first eight months of this year from billion in the same period of last year while imports tumbled16 percent in the same period

nbc s new drama the player has one of the most ridiculous premises of any of the new fall tv shows but that s not a bad thing 
unlike so many of the shows trying to cut through the clutter with a splashy concept the player knows exactly what it wants to be a high octane crime thriller that doesn t take itself too seriously 
and it shouldn t with a setup like this alex kane philp winchester is a private security specialist in las vegas who after the murder of his wife ginny daisy betts is pulled into a long running conspiracy involving the richest people in the world gambling on crime 
with the help of pit boss mr 
johnson wesley snipes and the dealer cassandra charity wakefield alex as the player tries to stop crimes while the fat cats in the house bet on or against his ability to save the day 
got all that 
we knew we wanted to make a pulp show co creator john rogers tells tvguide com 
the way pulp works is to find a good simple defining metaphor and we said what are the elements of gambling 
if you re going to have a conspiracy you re going to have code names you re going to a have a structure 
when we looked at the basic form of gambling the feel of a casino and it just came very naturally 
people understand those terms millions of people gamble 
we re not introducing obscure vocabulary to explain our very high concept obscure conspiracy 
fall preview check out all the must watch new shows but it was also important for rogers to have some emotional context beneath all the las vegas window dressing 
everyone right now feels as if maybe the rules were changed on them rogers says 
you sent your kids to college but somehow your college graduate is living in your basement because he can t get a job 
it feels like we re trapped in a game that somebody changed the rules 
we said why don t we externalize that 
why don t we talk about the fact we are trapped in a game and there s one guy in the middle of it who is on our side 
that gave us the emotional stakes of the show 
page of for alex his journey is entirely fueled by the heartbreak he feels over the death of his wife 
trying to resolve how ginny died and why she died and who s responsible is the primary emotional thrust of his investigation rogers says 
that s the thing that keeps him going back undercover into this organization 
and continuing to go back in is an issue 
after all the whole concept of a group of people profiting off of crime rather than trying to prevent it is pretty icky right 
they re doing a horrible thing rogers says with a laugh 
it allows us to have some fun every week but they re plainly bad guys 
alex is a good guy in the middle of a bad system 
one of the essential questions of the show is is that system actually the best possible system that we can live with 
because of alex s unease about what he s doing the player is unlike most procedurals where the team is one big happy family 
instead when in the pilot alex threatens to kill mr 
johnson one day in the not too distant future you re inclined to believe him 
however the team still has to rely on each other regardless of how much they trust their colleagues 
everyone has their own agenda everyone has their own secret plan and everyone has their own sort of shifting allegiances rogers says 
they are in a life and death world and they have to trust each other as far as they can to not die but never trust each other enough to make themselves vulnerable 
the player s wesley snipes and more familiar faces in new places that central conflict will certainly begin to define mr 
johnson s moral ambiguity which is exactly what attracted snipes to the role 
i get to explore some character work in a way that i probably couldn t in a feature film snipes says 
you never know which side he s playing for 
you ll learn quickly that mr 
johnson knows secrets that no one else knows 
he s seen a lot of players come and go and this guy is nothing special at this point 
or so we make it appear 
mr 
johnson has another card that he hasn t played yet 
there s a whole deck that mr 
johnson hasn t played yet 
however rogers is quick to caution people from deciding outright that mr 
johnson is the bad guy 
there are weeks that mr 
johnson does something heroic because it fits his sense of personal ethics and you re like yeah i love mr 
johnson 
rogers says 
then there are days that he s the most horrible human being in the world 
i don t know if you ever want to be rooting for him but you should be fascinated by him 
his views on power are not necessarily wrong they re just horrible 
page of then again alex isn t an entirely noble hero either 
he s saving lives 
he genuinely enjoys the work but alex kane has a problem 
he is a man with a high capacity for violence and a tendency towards it rogers says 
to a great degree the two themes for the show are power and addiction 
we all have behaviors we re drawn to 
we all have those things we can t let go of be it ginny s death or the constant fall into violence which comes very easily to him 
we all have these desires that are beyond our control and how we deal with them to a great degree is what defines us 
although the show is clearly reveling in its procedural makeup i love the one and done of it rogers confesses the writers are telling a longer story 
however the central mystery of ginny s murder which gets much more messy by the end of the pilot won t be stretched out forever 
the mystery of how that happened who did it why it was done all of that is meant to be an important thing that we reveal to the audience over the course of the first episodes rogers says 
we re not going to hold you over a barrel for five years 
most of the questions in the first season will be resolved by the end of the first season 
the player premieres thursday at 9c on nbc 
will you watch

tim ernst grew up in williamsville playing video games like mega man and the legend of zelda on his console and ultima and warcraft read tim ernst grew up in williamsville playing video games like mega man and the legend of zelda on his console and ultima and warcraft on his computer 
i loved them 
they were something i just saw so much potential in ernst said 
it was always heartbreaking to play a game that was terrible 
and if you played one that was amazing it was just an unbelievable experience 
today he gets to play and design and develop video games for a living 
ernst is general manager of kabam games where he oversees about employees in the company s san francisco development studio 
he s playing a leading role in the company s latest mobile game star wars uprising which came out thursday and is tied to the eagerly awaited next installment in the star wars movie franchise set for release in december 
kabam has found a niche in making interactive role playing games for smartphones and tablets 
the games are free to download and play but offer users the chance to pay for additional items within the game 
it s one segment of the massive highly competitive video game market in which ernst got his start with an internship at ubisoft while studying at yale university 
he later worked at sega of america and bedlam games before joining kabam four years ago 
the canisius high school graduate spoke to the news during a recent trip to western new york where he visited family and tried to squeeze in stops at duff s famous wings gabriel s gate mighty taco wegmans and other hometown favorites 
q is making video games work 
a clearly we re not just playing games 
we to a certain extent do rocket science inside of video games 
but it s sure enjoyable it s an industry full of passionate people 
q kabam s niche is in role playing games or rpgs for mobile devices 
what are they 
a a role playing game is really a video game world 
it s got to be complete with people you talk to a story 
but your character your customization your choices as well as how you interact with both people in the game and other people playing the game is what makes the genre unique 
q are role playing games a small part of the market compared to console and pc games 
a no it is it not a small segment of the overall industry 
in fact multiple games last year made over billion themselves 
so there has been success 
and the people that have been successful have stayed at the top for a long period of time 
it s also a growth market because of international specifically china 
china s a huge market that console games traditional games have not been able to break into 
q how do you provide the immersed gaming experience you get from playing on a desktop or console to people playing on their phones 
a that s one of the things that we re trying to pioneer 
we just released a game seven months ago called marvel contest of champions which is a fighting game that had some light story elements 
and really it s about making it a game it s not a mobile game being an apology 
so we re trying to push more the true classic video game experiences inside of a phone 
and that does mean that if we re making an rpg role playing game we have to tell our story a little differently our pacing s very different 
q star wars uprising will be free to download and play 
how does kabam make money through the game 
a the basis of free to play is everybody can download it because we want as many people as possible to start playing it 
and really the core of free play is being able to offer people what we call pay against the grind so if you want to do something in the game and it s going to take you a couple of extra hours it s not like a timer but let s say i have to run dungeons there s a route to kind of make that a lot shorter 
it s optional 
q how does the game fit within the star wars storyline 
a star wars uprising is set in the anoat sector which you could call the empire strikes back sector 
so it s hoth cloud city the planets around there 
and it s right after return of the jedi so this is time that nobody has explored in games 
basically after the emperor death star ii and the emperor is killed the governor of the system governor adelhard basically puts an iron blockade down 
now he s an imperialist 
he believes that what the empire s doing is truly great for the galaxy 
and he puts a blockade that prevents trade that prevents rebel propaganda 
but ultimately you re pushing back against adelhard s iron blockade 
and there s five factions 
the rebel alliance is one of the factions 
q is it completely open ended or is there a way to win the game 
a i don t know that there s winning because it s a living world 
but clearly you want to win you want to beat the empire 
and we don t really look at it as just a game or a packaged product 
this is a service and we want to create the star wars community the place for everyone to live their star wars dream 
so how you push back against the empire is part of the game and one of the parts that will evolve 
and as the community reacts t

the single rhett was terrified to release has since become his fastest rising biggest selling song 
and nestled in the country billboard top this summer betwixt hits like sam hunt s party hearty house party and like a wrecking ball the soulful sex jam from erich church his risk at least feels of the moment 
there is comfort in acknowledging the chart busting success of genre blurring acts like florida georgia line who rhett has supported on tour luke bryan and hunt whose nearly pure pop and r b debut album has made him something of a controversial pioneer 
it s very liberating rhett said in an interview reflecting on his move away from bro and towards something entirely new 
someone the other day was like man i don t know if you know this but i feel like you re on the brink of leading a new direction of music 
but in the minds of traditionalists a new direction isn t something to which a country musician should aspire 
to guys like kyle coroneos who runs the website savingcountrymusic com country is a genre not to be tampered with 
country music is about preserving tradition 
it always has been and always will be 
he calls this disco edm iteration a bro hangover the idea that bringing other genre influences into country right now is risky or pushing the envelope or taking the genre somewhere new and exciting is disingenuous he says 
instead it contributes to one giant mono genre which he believes the merging of hip hop and country has become 
the risk for country music is when you start going this far out of your boundaries you begin to lose control of the music you begin to lose control of your identity he said 
country music is unique because it has so much of its own infrastructure and traditions no other genre of music has four major awards shows every year not even rock or edm or rap 
the genre blending and trend chasing is exactly the fate that befell rock radio he said 
in the 1990s and early 2000s rock became the catch all phrase he said 
what happened was it lost its identity and it sort of imploded 
i think it could happen with country music 
rhett doesn t believe his music is going to cause the downfall of country music 
we re one of those genres that sort of lives in this bubble that everyone is a little bit scared to poke that bubble because we re worried about what will happen when that bubble breaks said rhett 
to me i want to be that artist that when my buddies are watching me side stage they ll say dang i can t believe they just did that in their concert or they hear a song on the record and go how in the world did they cut that song and get away with it there s something kind of rebelliously fun about it 
he cites mainstream country rebel church as inspiration his latest rock influenced record the outsiders is stacked with successful radio hits despite its many middle finger to the man moments 
but in the minds of critics that rebelliousness is a far cry from the stuff of willie waylon and more indicative of nashville chasing the next biggest money making thing 
despite all of the pop experimentation the country music genre lives in two stubborn solitudes there s real country and there s that crap you hear on the radio 
but if you re going to refer to something as real country you have to have a definition of what real country is 
if thomas rhett wants to put out an album in the style of bruno mars and have edm and r b stuff i am for it 
you go thomas rhett 
you do that 
but don t do it and sell it to country fans country music s identity is very much rooted in geography there s texas swing out of the lone star state there s kentucky bluegrass there s the bakersfield sound in california which was a grittier more direct response to the slick sounds coming out of countrypolitan nashville 
perhaps the current outcry of traditionalists is a little reminiscent of the origins of rock n roll the combination of blues country and gospel broke all the rules in the 1950s and pushed so many gatekeeper buttons 
while rhett s hip gyrations are the closest he ll ever get to elvis maybe his bruno mars covers are indeed pushing the boundaries in a good way reminding the country music world that nothing ever new or interesting has come from colouring inside the lines 
and if there would be no rock n roll without blues country and gospel there would be no co 
in her wexner retrospective filmmaker penelope spheeris excavates her iconic and primal past it was black flag squatting in a dilapidated church 
darby crash muttering his classic puzzled panther musings 
a coked up ozzy cooking an egg or the infamous scene of w a s p 
guitarist chris holmes chugging straight vodka from his swimming pool as his mother looks on 
director penelope spheeris iconic decline of western civilization series of documentaries were fly on the wall portraits of the los angeles subcultures in full bloom and in mid decay 
but for the longest time save the occasional midnight screening or happened upon bootleg vhs copy the decline films and their raw portrayal of the burgeoning punk and metal scenes were never given their proper due in the age of the dvd 
that s all about to change with the shout 
factory re issues of the entire trilogy filled with hours and hours of extras giving spheeris a closure to her work 
there were no copyright issues or finagling with bands wanting a chunk of change in their twilight years it was simply a matter of spheeris feeling instinctively unnerved at watching her life pass before her 
it was footage she couldn t handle watching 
speaking with a very confident and still invigorated spheeris it was apparent she knows her arena as a filmmaker 
despite being responsible for hits such as wayne s world black sheep and to a lesser degree the little rascals it s the decline films that have become her calling card and life s work 
the only way to convey her enthusiasm about her upcoming visit to the wexner center to introduce the landmark first film is through our brief but enlightening conversation 
growing up around a lot of cultural shifts during the decline of western civilization you were in your mid 30s 
were you a part of that scene 
what drew you to document that particular punk scene in los angeles 
i had been going to those punk clubs 
i was definitely a part of the scene and i knew most of the people in the movie before i decided to make a movie 
i was older but i think i was still working out my childhood issues and i saw their childhood issues and decided to make a film about it 
speaking of childhoods i truly feel that the film shaped the way i appreciate music and what i appreciate so that s a really good answer 
good 
that s good to hear 
i guess the same question is relevant for the decline of western civilization ii the metal years which was made seven years later 
were you equally attracted to the metal scene in los angeles or were you just playing the role of documentarian 
i ll have to be honest with you 
i was going to those clubs too 
i wouldn t have made that movie if i wasn t a part of that scene as well 
i m ashamed to admit that i was a part of that scene 
you shouldn t be ashamed 
i think in a lot of ways those first two films were blueprints for their respective scenes or genres 
especially the metal years where putting a band like london up against clips of ozzy and kiss posed an interesting juxtaposition 
i haven t talked about this much because with these re releases i didn t want to watch any of it 
i was forced to watch this again 
i couldn t handle it 
but when i look at them i see so many aspects of attitude and style and trends that are still prevalent to everyday life 
when i filmed them they were unique 
just the jargon even the language the word headbanging for instance 
i love the part when the audience members are explaining to you just exactly what headbanging entailed 
yeah 
i think that was eventually a cemented part of our culture with the bohemian rhapsody scene in wayne s world 
at the same time it kind of killed the authenticity of something that was once an honest part of a culture 
i didn t want to even touch wayne s world and just focus on the decline films but i do think that for you wayne s world may have been this zenith of punk and metal like your ironic raspberry towards what was then considered alternative i think i got to do wayne s world because of the metal years 
there wasn t anyone else who was a director in hollywood who knew anything about that music either way 
plus i knew lorne michaels 
it changed my life 
i kind of wished i hadn t made it only because i could have made the films i wanted to make but then i would ve been broke 
but yeah it pokes fun at a lot from my past for me seeing the original decline was a sort of cultural gauntlet 
i was and watching from a dubbed vhs copy 
did you have the foresight when you made it that it could be that type of landmark for that scene and that music 
well there was a guy in singapore the other day who asked me how the kids in the third decline could have seen the first decline since it wasn t available but you just explained it 
what happened was even though it wasn t available it became an underground contraband and established it that way 
is there any kind of subculture or counter culture that you see currently that is vital 
something that you would like to expose or document 
what is iv 
the answer to that and i m sure you ll understand is that today everyone has a camera 
i hate to say the subject matter because of that because anyone can go and make that movie now 
but somewhere deep down in the bottom of the hard drive of one of those movies is the beginning of decline iv 
i m looking forward to doing it and people are always for it 
spheeris will introduce the original decline of western civilization on friday october at the wexner center at p m 
parts ii and iii will screen on saturday october at p m

the rev 
rob lough told more than people at ward s funeral at first baptist church in roanoke about ward s compassion and laughter his passion and wit 
lough related several jokes that the virginia tech graduate would tell at the expense of archrival university of virginia 
lough told several stories including the time ward s principal at salem high school who uses a wheelchair challenged him to a race 
another story was about when ward disrupted the press box at virginia tech s football stadium by cheering after the hokies scored a touchdown 
lough says ward loved people and the people loved adam ward 
a m 
with mourners packing the modern massive first baptist church the funeral of slain wdbj tv cameraman adam ward is underway in roanoke 
five pews at the front left of the church were reserved for the family 
wdbj employees filled eight pews on the church s front right side 
a wreath of virginia tech orange and deep red flowers was draped over ward s closed casket 
he graduated from the school in

a funeral is set for a year old television cameraman who was fatally shot along with a station reporter 
adam ward s funeral will be held tuesday at first baptist church in roanoke virginia a few miles from where he worked

view more credit thorleif dörfel museum für naturkunde after being mostly neglected for more than a hundred years a group of digger wasps from australia has been given a major overhaul in terms of species descriptions and identification methods 
this approach has led to an almost rise in the number of recognized species of these wasps on the continent 
the study was published in the open access journal zookeys 
they call them with names like great golden digger or great black wasp in the us and there is a good reason behind it 
however some of these digger wasp species do not impress solely with their looks but also with their wide range of distribution 
members of the wasp genus sphex can be found in almost every area of the world 
two researchers from the museum für naturkunde in berlin thorleif dörfel and dr 
michael ohl have now reexamined the species diversity of sphex in australia 
more than a century has passed since the last revision of this group in the down under 
using pinned dried individuals from museum collections all over the world dörfel and ohl inspected over specimens and recorded the morphological characters that they deemed most useful for species differentiation 
a very different lifestyle sets apart some species in the genus sphex from the common idea that most people evoke on hearing the term wasp 
not being eusocial each female constructs a separate subterranean nest for their offspring which is then filled with grasshoppers or other insects depending on the wasp species that have been paralyzed by a sting as a food supply for the larvae 
these wasps avoid contact with humans and generally do not show aggressive behavior toward us 
with species known from australia before this study now the number has risen to 
most of these newly discovered species come from large quantities of material which had not been identified up to species level before 
dörfel and ohl s work also provides an up to date identification key both in a regular and in an interactive form that covers all known australian species of the genus 
specifically designed to be easily usable and containing many helpful images it can be utilized by anyone with even minimal prior training 
many insect groups are in urgent need of a revision or reclassification explained thorleif dörfel 
our understanding of ecosystems depends on the ability to identify the species that are a part of them 
the focus of this study was merely a single continent but we are currently preparing a follow up project in which we plan to examine representatives of this wasp genus from every major geographic area 
hopefully this is going to help everybody who works on these animals whether now or in another one hundred years

reuters pic frankfurt sept german auto giant volkswagen s shares plummeted nearly per cent yesterday as investigations spread into revelations that hundreds of thousands of its diesel cars have software that secretly thwarts us pollution tests 
volkswagen the world s largest automaker by sales in the first half of this year said it had halted all diesel vehicle sales in the united states during a probe into the scandal which could lead to fines of more than us billion rm76 billion 
in addition to the environmental fines us authorities have reportedly launched a criminal investigation into the company 
according to the us authorities vw admitted that it had equipped about cars in the us with sophisticated software that covertly turns off pollution controls when the car is being driven and turns them on only when it detects that the car is undergoing an emissions test 
with the so called defeat device deactivated the car can spew pollutant gases into the air including nitrogen oxide in amounts as much as per cent higher than emissions standards said the us environmental protection agency which announced the allegations friday along with california authorities 
using a defeat device in cars to evade clean air standards is illegal and a threat to public health said cynthia giles enforcement officer at the epa 
in germany currently hosting the frankfurt motor show vaunting the industry s strengths and environmental credentials the government launched an investigation into whether volkswagen or other carmakers are doing anything similar in germany or europe 
transport minister alexander dobrindt told the bild daily that he had asked germany s federal motor transport authority to immediately have specific and extensive tests conducted on all volkswagen diesel models by independent experts south korea s yonhap news agency said that authorities there too would conduct emissions tests on three volkswagen car models in mid october to check for similar deception 
beyond the potential fines and lawsuits and the billions of euros that evaporated in volkswagen s stock market value as its shares plunged per cent to rm635 wiping out more than us billion the company faces a potentially crippling blow to its reputation 
criminal probe launched the vehicles affected are four cylinder vw and audi diesel cars in the us built since 
in addition to the epa s probe the us department of justice has launched a criminal investigation into the german automaker s alleged violation of us air pollution laws according to media reports yesterday 
first reported by bloomberg the criminal probe piles more pressure on vw 
contacted by afp neither the justice department nor volkswagen chose to comment on the probe 
the epa said that the agency had not issued a formal recall for the vw vehicles but expects to compel the company to issue a recall to reduce the emissions impacts of those vehicles 
depending on the complexity of the repair and the lead time needed to obtain the necessary components it could take up to one year to identify corrective actions develop a recall plan and issue recall notices the us agency said 
the epa also said yesterday that it will screen for defeat devices in other manufacturers diesel vehicles currently on the road though declined to identify the automakers whose vehicles will be tested 
deeply sorry vw chief executive martin winterkorn issued an apology sunday vowing that the group would cooperate with authorities and ordering an external investigation of its own into the matter 
the board of management takes these findings very seriously 
i personally am deeply sorry that we have broken the trust of our customers and the public 
we will cooperate fully with the responsible agencies with transparency and urgency to clearly openly and completely establish all of the facts of this case winterkorn said 
we at volkswagen will do everything that must be done in order to re establish the trust that so many people have placed in us and we will do everything necessary in order to reverse the damage this has caused 
this matter has first priority for me personally and for our entire board of management winterkorn said 
christian stadler of warwick business school said there was no question that this is a big problem for volkswagen and could lead to ceo winterkorn losing his job after all winterkorn has been chief executive since but clashed with other leadership earlier this year 
image damaged stefan bratzel director at the center for automotive management a research group said the damage to vw s image would be as great as the financial fines 
another leading german auto expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer agreed 
it will be tough for vw to regain its credibility in the united states after this incident he said 
in the us edmunds com analyst jessica caldwell said it is in volkswagen s best interest to publicly address steps to fix this mess as soon as possible before it loses its customer base for good german economy minister sigmar gabriel expressed confidence that vw would clear up the matter quickly and thoroughly 
and he insisted the reputation of made in germany technology would not be tarnished

australia is legally obliged to take it back 
a completely different proposition from the hare brained idea of importing foreign nuclear wastes 
under commonwealth and state laws no nuclear waste repository can be set up in australia with just this one exception 
the nuclear lobby and the south australian government will use this exception to confuse the public so that this exception could become a foot in the door for the ill advised plan by some greedy australian individuals and by the desperate overseas nuclear companies for south australia to become the world s nuclear toilet

cristiano ronaldo scored five goals and became real madrid s all time top scorer in the primera division as he inspired los blancos to a thumping win at espanyol 
the portugal forward s impressive haul saw him move ahead of alfredo di stefano and raul in one afternoon to amass a total of goals in matches one ahead of raul who needed games to reach his tally 
ronaldo who had failed to score in either of madrid s opening league games needed just seven minutes to open his account against espanyol having bagged a treble here last season 
he promptly scored again from the penalty spot and then completed his hat trick on minutes with the help of a cross from gareth bale 
karim benzema added a fourth before the break and then in the second half bale again laid on the pass for ronaldo to strike for the fourth time and make real madrid history 
but he was still not done converting again from inside the area on minutes 
islamabad the presidency clarified on wednesday that president mamnoon hussain had no intention to lead the pml n campaign for local government elections in sindh 
president mamnoon hussain as a symbol of the federation is above politics and has no political motives the president s spokesman said rejecting the ppp s objection to his participation in a pml n meeting despite a ban on his taking part in political activities by the court 
according to a press release issued by the pm office on monday prime minister sharif and president hussain co chaired a meeting of the pml n sindh office bearers held at the prime minister s house 
the party s sindh general secretary briefed the president and the prime minister on the district committees set up in all districts of the province to launch mass contact campaigns it said 
the ppp whose co chairman asif ali zardari had been criticised for holding dual offices and convening meetings of the party at the presidency said it wondered how president hussain could chair a political meeting of the ruling party 
the ppp is surprised that unlike former president asif zardari the incumbent president is no longer restrained by the court order from participating in partisan political meetings ppp s spokesman farhatullah babar said in a statement on tuesday 
but the president s spokesman said there is no truth in the reports that the president will lead the pml n campaign for the local bodies elections in sindh the spokesman said in statement that in the past president hussain had for long been active in politics in sindh and had wide connections with the provincial leadership and workers due to which a large number of political workers remained desirous of meeting him in their individual capacity 
recently when office bearers of sindh pml n came to islamabad they expressed their desire to meet the president on a personal and social basis upon which prime minister nawaz sharif personally requested the president to informally visit the pm house and meet his former colleagues the spokesman said 
there were no political motives of the president behind that meeting he added 
the lahore high court had on may ruled that then president asif zardari should relinquish the post of ppp co chairman and the presidency should not be used for political activities 
the use of presidency for political activity is inconsistent with its sanctity dignity neutrality and independence 
therefore it is expected that the president of pakistan would cease the use of the premises of presidency for political meetings of his party the four judge bench of the lhc had said in its order on a petition filed by senior lawyer a k 
dogar on behalf of the pakistan lawyers forum challenging the holding of political office by mr zardari

many organizations are seeking to expand their operations overseas as part of their growth strategies 
in bahrain as well as around the world globalization has entered a new phase posing greater challenges for anti bribery and corruption abc compliance than ever before 
two factors are creating new issues for companies according to a recent report by kpmg international 
first a growing number of governments around the world are tightening abc regulations or introducing new ones as we see in bahrain 
in the light of kingdom s expanding corporate culture the government has introduced law number to expand the amiri decree number in order to address bribery and corruption across both the public and private sectors 
second as companies globalize their operations they rely more heavily on third parties than before to do business in far flung parts of the world often in areas where there is a high risk of corruption 
said the government has worked hard to enforce strict laws on bribery and corruption 
however as the global report highlights with gcc based organizations and businesses increasingly investing overseas reliance on and managing risk with third parties can be a challenge and adequate controls and monitoring must be put in place the survey conducted by kpmg international with respondents from around the world shows that companies are rising to the challenge but that a great deal more needs to be done to create a sturdy abc compliance structure 
for full details read the report 
the main findings of the survey include despite greater efforts to build abc frameworks it s clear that there are gaping holes in them says petrus marais global leader of forensic services for kpmg 
the problem is particularly acute in the management of third parties who increasingly act as conduits for bribes making it harder to track 
respondents to the survey admit it s the biggest challenge in the field of abc but they are not doing enough to develop a culture of compliance both among their employees and their vendors and other business associates about the survey the survey targeted respondents covering countries with respondents based in central eastern europe including russia in western european countries excluding the uk from the asia pacific region respondents in the u s from the south american continent in mexico in south africa and in the uk 
industries were widely represented banking comprised percent life sciences percent manufacturing percent and energy natural resources percent

three people s action party pap candidates have been declared winners and a sample count of the all votes indicated that seven of the eight opposition parties are unlikely to win a seat in parliament the channel news asia reported 
pap candidates cheryl chan grace fu and lam pin min have won their respective seat from fenghan yuhua and sengkang west constituencies

recently corrine bauer and pat melody members of my mindfulness meditation group held a vigil on behalf of hispanic immigrants locked up in the ramsey county adult detention center 
thanks to corrine and pat for being mindful of the welfare of others 
i m re posting the text below from labor day as it continues to be relevant in the context of the status of immigrants in this country and around the globe 
too many americans oppose immigration as they fear competition for jobs from immigrants seeking safe haven within us borders 
the success of an initiative by my employer a few years ago should lay those fears to rest 
nevertheless we continue to harass hispanic immigrants in the us while around the globe syrian refugees are too often turned away 
picture this i m a young waf assigned to clerical duties in an office on scott air force base near east st 
louis ill 
on this particular morning i overhear an air force major and a colonel both caucasian discuss the qualifications of a civil service employee under consideration for promotion the colonel apparently likes her resume 
then he asks is she caucasian negative the major replies 
here s the deal i m a caucasian who grew up in lily white rural northwestern ohio and this was the first time i d seen up close the ugliness of racial discrimination 
stunned i sat there at my typewriter trying to focus on my work 
in the weeks that follow i notice the employee in question is not promoted 
on the upside my stint in the military provided my first opportunity to make friends with members of other races and ethnic backgrounds 
i ve not forgotten hispanic maria venegas african americans katie harmon annie terry and adeline lincoln parisian french caucasian monique horlaville and new orleans french caucasian priscilla bertrand 
years passed before i encountered a comparable diversity in civilian life diversity fostered intentionally in the regional office of a large corporation located in a thriving upscale suburb 
admittedly the company s motives were more practical than altruistic 
at a department meeting tony our african american assistant manager asked if any of us knew what was behind the diversity initiative 
he rolled his eyes when i suggested that our company supported diversity because it was the right thing to do 
tony then explained the business case for diversity if we want to sell our products to the hmong community african americans hispanics gays women or other minority group we d best include their members in our workforce altruistic or not it s amazing how quickly people can adapt to an inclusive environment when their livelihoods are at stake and before long the plus employees in that huge office building formed a genuine community featuring many of the amenities and rituals of a small town 
sad to say our community by then a model of diversity became a casualty of corporate downsizing when thanks to technology our work was moved elsewhere 
but for quite a few years each of us had good cause for celebrating labor day 
perhaps the time will come when a majority of americans will have matured sufficiently to create similar communities whatever their context purely because it s the right thing to do

a target store built on land where the notorious cabrini green housing project once stood is shown on october in chicago illinois 
target is in it to win it this holiday season as the retail giant rolled out a brand new price match policy wednesday that promises to go as low as the prices at any of its largest competitors online or in store 
beginning oct 
target customers will be able to match the price of purchases made in store or on target com and they ll also have a longer timeframe to do so 
previously the minneapolis based corporation had a limited price match policy only allowing shoppers to get the lowest price matched from a small handful of retailers for items bought in person forcing customers to go from store to store to find the best deal 
they also only had days to do so 
the updated policy doubles that time frame allowing two full weeks for shoppers to get a price adjustment and allowing customers to search online or from their smartphone to do so 
target also added additional rival retailers to the expanded policy including for the first time stores with memberships such as costco and sam s club

on monday s edition of newsone now roland martin posed a question about the upcoming presidential election and one of the largest movements in recent history should the black lives matter movement invite republican and democratic presidential candidates to a debate forum in an attempt to force them to address issues important to the african american community there would be pros and cons behind holding the forum newsone now panelist paris dennard told martin it would be very telling to those candidates who take this seriously and who may not agree with the slogan or the hashtag but understand there are pros behind it he added those who get it and have staff that say this is something that you should do if you want to reach and have these inroads and tap into how america feels will show up 
those that won t they re not going to be there lauren victoria burke managing editor of politic365 com said i think we know who would not show up most of the republicans would not show up she continued jeb bush maybe marco rubio would show up martin then interjected with bush s free stuff faux pas from last week to which burke said that is how they market to black voters the welfare queen later martin suggested the forum would raise the black lives matter movement to a different level 
because if you go back to when you have the tea party that sponsored debates black lives matter movement should do it as well martin said 
martin believes a black lives matter sponsored presidential debate would force every democratic candidate to have to show up and speak to our issues watch roland martin gop strategist paris dennard and lauren victoria burke discuss the notion of the black lives matter movement hosting sponsoring a presidential candidate debate forum in the video clip above

expected change in u s 
healthcare industry will have a positive rub off on indian outsourcing sector s the united states gears up to implement the icd international classification of diseases coding system from october omega healthcare an offshore provider of medical revenue cycle services said this would open up large scale employment opportunities for medical coders especially in india 
obamacare and icd implementation open up vast opportunities for us as the demand for certified medical coders will go up sharply said gopi natarajan chief executive officer and co founder omega healthcare 
the market is hot 
both obamacare and migration to the icd new coding system provides an opportunity which is equal to the y2k shift a decade and half ago mr 
natarajan said 
complying with the new regulation for accurate identification of diseases and reimbursement of health insurance claims to healthcare service providers will be difficult as the number of codes will go up from as per icd to codes in icd 
as per world health organisation each disease has been assigned with a code based on which service providers get paid 
this would require high level of specificity to identify the actual disease or ailment suffered or treated 
it calls for very detailed documentation to establish the code and only experienced coders life science graduates with the adequate training can help in assigning the code leading to accurate billing 
it is believed that the implementation of icd will change the healthcare industry in united states and the outsourcing industry across the globe and the transition will create huge demand for certified medical coders across the globe especially in the u s middle east and in india 
we are fully prepared for the change 
we already have coders from our employee base and we will be hiring more people in the coming months mr 
natarajan said 
ninety seven per cent of our coders have been retrained for the transaction 
they have undergone hours of training 
we project a huge demand for trained coders in the coming months he said 
omega healthcare is on an expansion mode and plans to hire more than people by january 
while people will be added at its facility at chennai people will be hired at tiruchi and people at bengaluru 
last year the company opened a facility at manila in philippines where it has employed people and this facility has capacity to accommodate personnel mainly nurses who take patients calls 
in three years omega healthcare plans to have people as the market has potential for growth 
mr 
natarajan said the company would invest million to million a year from internal accruals to expand capacity to cater to the growing demand for outsourced medical services from the u s 
medical coding and billing is considered very crucial in the healthcare industry but the business process outsourcing bpo industry which provides these services is facing deficit of talent in the sector

prnewswire atlas venture leads series a joining existing seed investors omega funds and forbion capital partners replimune ltd replimune today announced the closing of a million series a financing led by atlas venture atlas 
atlas joins previous seed investors forbion capital partners forbion and omega funds omega as investors in this funding round 
replimune headquartered in oxford uk and with a significant presence in cambridge ma was founded in april to develop the next generation of oncolytic immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer 
jason rhodes partner at atlas will join the board of replimune together with otello stampacchia and sander slootweg of omega and forbion respectively 
oncolytic immunotherapy is an emerging class of cancer therapeutics which exploit the ability of viruses to selectively replicate in and kill tumor tissue while at the same time inducing a potent patient specific anti tumor immune response 
oncolytic viruses have the unique ability to generate an autologous immune response to the patient s particular complement of tumor antigens including neoantigens with a truly off the shelf approach 
while clear single agent clinical activity has been achieved with oncolytic immunotherapy it is anticipated that particular synergy may be observed in combination with immune checkpoint blockade and other immune modulatory approaches 
immune checkpoint blockade relies on a pre existing inflamed tumor microenvironment and a pre existing immune response to tumor neoantigens for clinical activity which are only present in some patients 
oncolytic immunotherapy can provide both of these and therefore combination of these two proven modalities is particularly logical and attractive 
replimune is developing novel proprietary oncolytic immunotherapies intended to improve both the direct anti tumor effects of selective virus replication and the potency of the immune response to the tumor antigens released 
replimune intends to progress these rapidly through clinical trials and to combine these with checkpoint blockade at an early stage of clinical development 
we are at the beginning of the age of immune oncology and believe that oncolytic viruses will be a powerful component of this emerging therapeutic approach said jason rhodes partner at atlas atlas is very pleased to be working with the exceptional and experienced team at replimune 
robert coffin replimune ceo and previously founder and cso of biovex inc said replimune is excited to be at the forefront of oncolytic immunotherapy and to partner with leading healthcare investors such as atlas forbion and omega in this funding round 
the funds raised will allow us to progress our next generation approach through to clinical data in multiple cancer indications including in combination with checkpoint blockade 
in addition to stand alone product development replimune will pursue a partnering strategy with companies with promising approved or experimental checkpoint blockade or other complementary immuno oncology drugs

the canberra capitals are poised to re sign reigning wnbl player of the year abby bishop in a massive boost to the club s hopes of ending a four year finals drought 
the canberra capitals are poised to re sign reigning wnbl player of the year abby bishop in a massive boost to the club s hopes of ending a four year finals drought 
bishop has been granted a release from her contract with hungarian club uniqa sopron and the capitals are deep in discussions with their incumbent captain 
the year old picked up a minor hamstring injury playing for seattle storm and was due to head to hungary next week but bishop and sopron have come to a mutual agreement 
it is understood the capitals hope to make an official announcement as early as this week 
bishop dominated the wnbl last year averaging points and rebounds and was a clear winner of the player of the year 
the capitals are very confident bishop s injury isn t a risk and she will get through the full season 
just a few weeks ago the capitals roster was severely depleted but they now look very much a finals contender after recruiting shrewdly since 
bishop s recruitment helps ease the capitals concerns in the post as they had been struggling to find a quality replacement after belgian centre ann wauters withdrew late due to family reasons 
star centre lauren jackson herself returning from knee surgery is the only specialist post player canberra currently has on its books 
but if both stay fit jackson and bishop will from arguably the most imposing front court partnership in the wnbl 
jackson s rehabilitation is progressing well and she plans to be back on court early in the season 
opals point guard kathleen macleod also pulled out after falling pregnant but the capitals compensated by signing former wnba all star renee montgomery last week 
montgomery s minnesota lynx has qualified for the wnba finals after disposing of phoenix in the western conference finals 
it means montgomery will miss at least the season opener against dandenong at ais arena on october and the week two games at sydney and townsville should the wnba finals go the full five games 
a lack of personnel particularly in the front court has forced the capitals to cancel its pre season game in sydney on saturday 
with jackson bishop and montgomery still absent just seven contracted players suited up in three games against south east queensland last weekend 
hanna zavecz injured her ribs at training last week and opals youngster steph talbot hit her head on the court against the stars 
the capitals aren t willing to risk the pair this week before the start of the wnbl season but both will be fit to play 
meanwhile the capitals are yet to finalise a deal which would see the majority of their home games shifted from ais arena to the royal theatre 
however it is understood the club is confident an agreement will be reached before season tip off 
it is hoped the move into the city to a smaller venue will ensure bigger crowds and a better atmosphere as the capitals shoot for a first finals appearance since

the photo sites of rite aid costco and wal mart canada also were affected in the breach 
cvs health corp 
said it started contacting potentially affected customers on friday

volleyball notebook another tourney title for trojans class 6a no 
jenks extended its winning streak to matches with a victory over third ranked edmond santa fe in the finals of the jenks invitational on saturday 
the trojans beat norman north chisholm and noah in pool play before advancing and beating cascia hall in the semifinals 
it s jenks second straight tournament title after claiming the bishop kelley tournament crown on sept 

having two tournament wins feels great not because of the wins so much as the girls reaching two of their four goals they set early on in the season when we were at team camp jenks coach tanna smith said 
i know my girls are excited as they hit milestone after milestone down their road to the state tournament jenks win over edmond santa fe atoned for the trojans loss to the wolves on aug

the bulldogs had gone in tournament play before settling for second place 
we really played well this weekend i thought said lincoln christian coach zac briscoe whose team had beaten mount saint mary on aug 

we just didn t play our best in the final and mount saint mary probably had a lot to do with that lincoln christian is now and will find out its regional tournament assignment thursday 
we ve played great all season and we are off to our best start in school history briscoe said 
but we need to retool some things and get better in the next few weeks to be ready for state mustangs charging hard okay missed out on last year s class 3a state tournament and that didn t sit well with the mustangs coach belinda clark said 
losing at regionals last year by just three points served as a motivator for these girls she said 
the 3a no 
mustangs have turned that inspiration into a record with the playoffs fast approaching 
clark also alluded to another reason for success 
having a court full of good hitters has also helped us she said 
we are not dependent on one or two 
we can hit from anywhere asked to point to a couple of key contributors clark couldn t help but name nearly everyone on her team hitters blockers karleigh mcmahan kirstyn anderson summer milligan and blake judkins setter jade hopkins libero macy haley and junior varsity call up emily taylor 
to ask who is leading the way i would have to say they all are clark said 
we wouldn t be where we are today without all of them together

gladstone s northern oil refinery is looking at expanding by taking on two apprentices and a lab technician 
the refinery at yarwun is the only facility in queensland that recycles waste lube oil back into base lube oil 
northern oil refineries general manager andrew smith who has been on the job for six months said the refinery was already looking to take on two apprentices and a lab technician 
we have the capacity to do million litres per annum but we are currently doing he said 
if more businesses gave us their used oil we could employ more people 
we ve only developed half of the site as well 
queensland shadow minister for environment stephen bennett visited the oil refinery yesterday 
they have taken on an exciting challenge and the innovation here has made them world leaders mr bennett said 
it s a great example of things to come in the waste management field 
it s the most environmentally responsible treatment of waste lube oil where every component of the waste lube oil is reused and of the lube oil is recovered as high quality lube oil for use 
we need more companies to have vision and continue to invest and properly deal with their waste 
jj richards and sons is responsible for transporting used oil to the site 
gladstone branch manager lockie mcgaw said oil came from all over queensland 
we can transport around 000l of oil 
it s not a big part of our region because we re diversified here in gladstone he said 
jj richards and sons business development manager richard taylor said most oil in the region came from mines and industries 
it s great to be able to have a circular economy where we can get something that is used and refine it back to quality lube oil to put back into the system he said

dame joan collins said she used to nag her sister jackie about getting mammograms but she refused 
jackie who sold more than million novels in more than countries in her four decades long career as a writer in raunchy female fiction died of breast cancer last saturday aged 
joan and jackie collins during the filming of the new year s eve graham norton show dame joan said she and her sister were thick as thieves but admitted they did have estrangements in the past 
despite being diagnosed six and a half years ago british author jackie who lived in beverley hills told few people about her illness saying she did not want to burden others with it 
in an online post called a tribute to my beloved sister dame joan wrote i used to nag my sister about getting mammograms as our darling mother elsa had succumbed to the disease in when she was only in her early fifties 
i was religious about doing mammograms regularly 
jackie however refused she didn t even like going to doctors 
like my brother and i she was needle phobic 
dame joan who said she and jackie were thick as thieves also revealed the moment jackie rang her to say she had stage four breast cancer 
she only found out about her sister s illness in the fortnight before her death 
she said jackie told her that she did not want to upset her adding that she said i know all the problems you ve been having in the past few years i didn t want to burden you with mine 
dame joan wrote my voice was so choked with tears i could hardly speak 
the pair who had been rumoured at times to have a difficult relationship were pictured together in london just a few days before the death when jackie was on a promotional tour for her new novel the santangelos 
in her tribute dame joan wrote jackie really enjoyed her life so much and lived it to the hilt and when we were together even if we hadn t seen each other for a few months we were thick as thieves 
dame joan said jackie hated her fourth husband peter holm adding she begged me not to marry him but unfortunately i went ahead one of the worst decisions of my life 
jackie and i didn t see each other so much during that period 
she went on unfortunately a couple of years later another relationship i had came between us and having moved back to europe we couldn t be as close as we wanted to be 
sisters will have their estrangements but happily when that relationship ended and i moved back to la jackie and i resumed our devotion to each other 
she added i ve never had a better girlfriend than jackie with whom i shared so much in common and could enjoy talking and gossiping away about everything when we were together going to our favourite restaurants or to the movies or on long distance phone calls 
in her concluding few lines dame joan said i don t think i will ever recover from the sadness of losing my beautiful baby sister 
she added she will live on in the wonderful memories i have of her from our childhood and particularly from the last fifteen years during which we were closer than ever 
i feel her spirit i hear her wonderful laugh and i see her all the time in the hundreds of photos of her that are sprinkled around my home 
she wasn t just a star to me she was an entire galaxy 
dame joan has requested that people who read her online tribute make donations to penny brohn cancer care in the uk and the susan g komen breast cancer organisation in the usa

how to employ effective seo practices categories all by myra love how to employ effective seo practices with the massive amount of online competition every site needs to rely on seo techniques to bring in a workable amount of traffic 
search engines provide consumers with a means to shop for just about anything read up on new companies and perform research 
use the helpful information in this article to get more traffic directed to your site and improve your bottom line 
when you develop seo pages it pays to have lots of shorter pieces on related topics instead of a single long one 
long pages get less weight than short ones 
also the majority of visitors will not spend the time necessary to read something that is extremely long 
mostly your site is supposed to entertain visitors and keep them clicking about 
a large part of using seo is bringing people to your website repeatedly and keeping them there 
seo is also what will help your search engine rankings 
as you build your site avoid thinking that lots of advertising is how to boost your rankings 
sure advertising can mean more visitors but that doesn t immediately equate to better page ranking 
be sure to use header tags 
sometimes these headers can be too big but you can use css to change the size 
search engines love headers and use them as a means to rank a website 
the tags h1 and h2 should highlight your service or product 
you need to put some thought into the anchor text you use for internal website links 
if you are only typing click here and subsequently linking that term that is doing absolutely nothing for your search engine results 
crawling spiders will notice you if you use the correct keywords for anchor text 
when designing your website it s important to know that spiders cannot read dynamic language or session id names 
certain language can confuse a search engine which is why each url should have a meaningful name as well as pertinent keywords 
search engines improve your rankings based not just on hits but also on the length of time of each hit 
you can find out how much time someone spends on your site with services such as quantcast scores 
there are a few ways to increase the visitors time spent 
forums blogs and posts that can replied to are all great means to increase visitors time spent on your site as they all build interest 
the way to do this is to make a robots text file and place it in your site s root directory 
txt file and inserting it in your site s root directory 
this will prevent any search engine from being able to gain access to particular files on your site 
present yourself as an experienced veteran of your field 
this tactic can really bring in the cash 
design your website around a certain niche and use seo techniques to drive those potential customers to your site so they can buy your products and services 
provide the customers with what they desire not what they may think that they desire 
site map another seo tool is to be involved in blogging 
blogs get ranked easily since search engine algorithms prefer highly structured data and new content 
if you want a high ranking with the search engines then backlinks are an important part of this 
create a site map for your website to help the major search engines index each of your site s pages 
the site map or navigation bar lets the search engines access your pages from all other pages on the site 
a site map may have a significant impact on search engine rankings even for small websites 
to get the best possible search engine rankings learn all you can about social website marketing and take full advantage of the free advertising opportunities 
go beyond twitter and facebook 
there are a lot of specialized social media sites that cater to folks interested in things like photography or dog breeding 
join any that seem relevant to your niche and use it as a method to promote your services or products and improve your ranking 
you want to be sure you provide a focused effort to each page of your site 
you don t want to promote everything you sell in one single post or article 
this will confuse your readers and discourage them from returning 
a page focused on one program will have much better success results 
establish a sight map with keywords 
a site map is an easy to read easily accessible directory of every area on your website 
it gives users a simple way to find what they re looking for on your site 
site maps are also useful indexing tools for search engines as accessibility is a highly desirable trait 
to avoid the spam filters of the search engines avoid duplicating any content on your site 
this could happen by accident 
it might be quicker to use the same product description over and over again but search engines might not be able to distinguish this from spamming 
it is possible to make any particular page of any website more friendly to search engines by inserting keywords in the url of those particular pages 
the page won t rank high if the url has numbers or symbols 
including relevant keywords improves a page s traffic 
search engines successfully optimizing your site for search engines may seem intimidating but as this article has shown you it doesn t have to be difficult 
knowing the few basic principles that determine how the search engines work can help you tweak your site to attract more visitors than ever 
before you know it you ll have a slew of new customers 
be active on your blog you will increase your search engine ranking by doing so

cnn matt damon plays an astronaut stranded in space in his latest movie and nasa is capitalizing on his star power to promote its future travels to mars 
the martian star was tapped for a nasa video about real life efforts to explore mars in the latest cross promotion between the film and the space agency 
nasa collaborated on the film with 20th century fox entertainment providing guidance on production design and technical consultants 
for its part nasa is making the most of its hollywood connection to educate the public on space exploration and burnish its brand in the process 
it even launched a page the real martians dedicated to the topic 
the film combines fictional and factual narratives about mars based on work of nasa and others have done 
in the film which takes place in the 2030s astronauts regularly travel to mars and live on the surface to explore 
the martian is set to open october 
sending people to mars and returning them safely is the challenge of a generation damon says in the nasa video 
journey to mars will forever change our history books rewriting what we know about the red planet and expanding the human presence deeper into the solar system 
for better or worse it often takes a little hollywood magic to capture the public s attention especially when it comes to science 
so how does a mission to mars play out 
journey to mars begins on international space station right now some miles above land on the international space station american astronaut scott kelly and russian cosmonaut mikhail kornienko are studying the effect of long periods without gravity on the human body 
the one year mission on the space station will help prepare for future journeys 
kelly led a twitter chat saturday six months into his mission sharing insights into what they ve learned so far 
no drop of sweat coffee or urine goes to waste on the station thanks to the environmental control and life support system 
the system recovers and recycles water from various sources so it can be reclaimed and filtered for consumption through the water recovery system 
the international space station uses a deployable fresh food production system known as veggie to build a continuous source of food 
using red blue and green lights veggie helps plants grow in pillows small bags with a wicking surface containing media and fertilizer to be harvested by astronauts 
astronauts used the system to grow red romaine lettuce in a huge step in space farming 
getting there future trips to mars could take days or longer so it better be a smooth ride 
the vehicle that will bring crews to space is the orion spacecraft which will provide emergency abort capability sustain the crew during the space travel and bring them back safely 
orion will launch on nasa s new heavy left rocket the space launch system staying there although the martian takes place years in the future nasa is already working on many of the technologies that appear in the film 
damon s character astronaut mark watney spends time in the habitation module known as the hab 
future astronauts who land on mars will need such a home to survive 
at johnson space center in houston crews train for long duration deep space missions in the human exploration research analog known as hera a self contained environment that simulates a deep space habit 
the two story habitat contains living quarters workspaces a hygiene module and a simulated airlock 
crews stay in the habitat for days at a time conducting operational tasks completing payload objectives and learning how to live together in an isolated environment 
in the film watney fends for himself with limited supplies after his crew leaves him behind believing him dead 
to pass time he goes for a spin on his rover which is based on nasa s multi mission space exploration vehicle 
the vehicle has been used in nasa s analog mission projects to troubleshoot and develop capabilities to support missions to an asteroid mars its moons and elsewhere 
it s built to handle address issues such as range rapid entry and exit and radiation protection 
some versions of the vehicle have six pivoting wheels for maneuverability 
in the instance of a flat tire the vehicle simply lifts up the bad wheel and keeps on rolling 
watney spends most of his sol martian day in a spacesuit to protect himself from the cold atmosphere lack of breathable air and dust 
nasa is working on two new prototypes to identify technology gaps between current spacesuits and ones sufficient for setting foot on mars 
through the z and prototype exploration spacesuits spacesuit engineers are examining the tradeoff between hard composite materials and fabrics to strike a balance between durability and flexibility

jonny wilkinson has a sharp eye 
anyone who has seen him kick a ball knows that especially those who saw his world cup winning drop goal in extra time in the final between australia and england 
jonny wilkinson has a sharp eye 
anyone who has seen him kick a ball knows that especially those who saw his world cup winning drop goal in extra time in the final between australia and england 
wilkinson doesn t raise the subject of that kick in an interview with fairfax media but when asked he still fondly recalls the moment that is etched in rugby folklore 
as soon as i dropped it i knew i wasn t going to smash it out the back of the stadium but i knew it was going to go straight 
it was exactly what i was asking for he says with the softest of laughs 
fast forward to today 
even in retirement wilkinson still has that sharp eye 
okay he no longer needs to use it for sizing up kicks or reading a game from his old playmaking position at no 
however wilkinson who retired from test rugby in december with test caps for england and the british and irish lions and all professional rugby in may last year has a sharp eye for talent 
when asked about two world cup players of contrasting size experience and arguably rugby ability who could be much spoken of by the time the world cup ends on november wilkinson says wallabies veteran matt giteau 85kg 178cm and the sole survivor in this wallabies squad of that losing side with tests caps since his test debut 
and england rookie sam burgess 116kg 196cm with two test caps and a world cup debutant a little less than one year since leaving the nrl premiership winning rabbitohs 
pending selections both centres could square off in their crucial pool a game at twickenham on october 6am aest or even in the final if both teams qualify 
wilkinson s esteem for giteau was clear in may last year when he said i don t quite know how a team ever let him go in australia after giteau missed world cup selection in and joined toulon 
wilkinson believes the wallabies fate will largely hinge on giteau who returned to the team after the australian rugby union changed its selection policy on overseas based players 
the previously closed door is now open to those with tests and seven non consecutive years in an australian super rugby team 
asked if giteau s most valuable asset is his ability or experience wilkinson says the fact he has been able to accumulate all that experience all that decision making ability all that composure all that wealth of knowledge and rugby wisdom is huge 
but what s amazing is that he is still plays with a kind of youthful exuberance that allows him to still be a game breaker at any point 
that combination makes him dangerous 
he is still one of the guys who can make the or yard break 
he is still the guy that is creating things 
but he is still the guy sitting back saying now is the time to do this and directing the team 
he could be the one who could turn a game from losing to winning in an instant 
wilkinson believes players like giteau are crucial to any world cup team 
the game is largely at the feet of these kind of players wilkinson says 
it is amazing how dominant and the effect the guy has had on the top 
and the top in france is not a competition in the way it is played that should allow itself to be defined by someone playing in the centre role 
but he has done it 
when you leave space or offer options and you give him a platform to play with give him some decent ball when he wants it it is like a red rag to a bull after that 
that is exactly what he did and that is exactly what he will do for australia 
despite voices to the contrary wilkinson steadfastly believes burgess should be in england s world cup squad just one year into his code switch 
he is an enormous talent wilkinson says 
wilkinson says burgess leadership traits are a top priority in terms of being a team guy 
he also cites as inspirational qualities his strength in defence and attack adding that with what he brings to a team with his aura you have a very special player 
however wilkinson recognises burgess is far from the finished product 
there are certain elements that are just rugby you can take off union or league it s just rugby wilkinson says 
he has all that the rugby part 
the union part is just positional 
there are the subtle nuances and largely to a degree it goes beyond that to managing the game and everyone has to do that nowadays 
wilkinson believes picking burgess or not should come down to balancing his strengths and weaknesses 
you have got to weigh up how much are we willing to take knowing that maybe there may have been another season in there to build his game up wilkinson says 
but then you look at the weight of the balance on the other side and say this guy is just too strong 
his presence is too formidable in terms of how it affects other guys 
and you say actually that is going to be the most beneficial thing in terms of how you might want to use him 
and if they are using him off the bench they can control that game management side because they will be able to send messages on with him 
wilkinson hopes burgess enjoys a long future in english rugby saying he is a once in a generation kind of player in what he brings with that personal strength 
i am a big fan of his and a lot of the other guys coming across from league 
this game of ours is won just like any other game it takes a lot of time to learn it 
that goes for us who ve played it all our lives not just guys who are coming over

while menopause affects women physically it s not the lack of sex night sweats or fatigue that leave men feeling unloved 
it s the emotional loss of their partner 
houston tx prweb september menopause is no longer just for older women with hot flashes irritability and night sweats 
an estimated baby boomer women in the u s 
reach menopause every day and suffer both physical and emotional symptoms that can linger and interfere with their relationships and marriages 
hesitant to share her new emotions with her husband divorce sometimes ensues 
men often wonder why she rejects him in the bedroom why she doesn t want to go out as much and why she seems colder more anxious and feels old unattractive overweight tired overwhelmed and confused or depressed says mary jo rapini a licensed psychotherapist and co author of newly published re coupling a couple s step guide to greater intimacy and better sex 
while menopause affects women physically it s not the lack of sex night sweats or fatigue that leave men feeling unloved 
it s the emotional loss of their partner 
he sees her as still being beautiful witty charming sexy and his main confidante 
anyone who has ever tried to tell a woman she is beautiful when she believes she is not understands how futile it is and how easily she will dismiss the comment even if it was said with sincerity these tips help couples cope with the change and can even draw one another closer 
don t take menopause symptoms personally 

explore new ways to be intimate the ones you traditionally used may not be comfortable anymore 

when she s most irritable or angry ask her what s going on it most likely has nothing to do with you 

if there s a problem don t ignore it talk about it 

if she s having hot flashes cuddling or sleeping together might be too uncomfortable 
allow her space but let her know you re there 

many women suffer with their loss of fertility 
be patient listen and don t make jokes 

there are no quick medical treatments available for the physical or emotional aspects as helpful as a loving supportive partner 
hormone therapy helps but it isn t a magic cure and many women cannot use it 

if sex is being avoided it doesn t mean she doesn t love you anymore 
it might be painful 
replens is a non hormonal moisturizer that provides comfortable relief for three days and a good silicone lubricant like wet platinum or replens silky smooth should be used just before and during sex 

fifty is a tough time for men too so be patient with one another 
mid life is a couple s challenge 
many men are silently suffering from erectile dysfunction 
stronvivo is a nutritional supplement that improves blood flow and erectile function by keeping blood circulating smoothly throughout the body delivering nutrients and oxygen to the brain muscles organs and skin 
natural pharmaceutical grade ingredients including l arginine and l citrulline among others to support healthy hormone levels resulting in stronger erections for men making it a perfect companion to testosterone replacement therapy and increased sexual desire for women enhancing lubrication arousal and orgasms while reducing vaginal pain 

depression and anxiety can be part of menopause 
take it seriously and encourage her to talk to a mental health care professional if her symptoms become severe or persistent 
couples who embrace the change in life as a temporary condition and go through it together do much better and remain much closer than those who don t adds rapini

new york has seen the lights go out in spectacular ways in recent years 
almost the entire state went dark during the great northeast blackout of and power outages sporadically shut down the emergency services system 
in more than million upstate residents were plunged into darkness after a major ice storm split trees and crumbled the grid 
and in hurricane sandy damaged power plants and equipment shutting the power to millions of residents for days 
these events and the certainty of more in the future have given the state plenty of reasons to look for new ways to prevent power loss in emergencies 
in the search for solutions though a major problem keeps popping up 
the standard model for a region s electric grid is built around one or a few large plants producing electricity and shipping it often long distances on transmission lines to customers 
if the plant or the line goes down so does the grid 
for authorities trying to overcome this structural issue one idea is getting a serious look 
it s called a microgrid and officials from potsdam to brooklyn are betting that the concept will keep the lights on the next time an unwelcome visitor threatens the flow of electricity to hospitals and other vital facilities 
much of new york s effort is predicated on resiliency says lavelle freeman the manager of distribution planning and engineering for ge s energy consulting business 
sandy is just the most recent example that has people asking what you do to prevent the grid from collapsing for an extended period of time at its heart a microgrid is a standalone power system embedded within a region s grid that can operate independently when a power outage starts 
during a disruption a microgrid acts as a powered island that keeps critical infrastructure like fire and gas stations clinics and telecommunications systems running
