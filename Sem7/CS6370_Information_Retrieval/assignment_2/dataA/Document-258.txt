  NEW DELHI: Lenovo-owned Motorola seems to be ready with another smartphone launch in India. After announcing the Moto Z and Moto Z Force last month, Motorola is now gearing up to launch its sub-Rs 10,000 third-generation Moto E handset. While Motorola hasn't revealed much about the Moto E3 smartphone, rumours suggest that the company will launch it in September.     The Motorola Moto E3 will feature a 5-inch 720p display and will be powered by a quad-core CPU. The smartphone will run stock Android 6.0 Marshmallow and be backed by a 2,800mAh battery.     The company had launched two variants -- 3G and 4G -- of the second-generation Moto E. However, Motorola is expected to launch only a 4G LTE-enabled Moto E3 handset. On the camera front, the Moto E3 is expected to feature an 8MP rear camera along with a 5MP front camera.     The device is expected to be priced around 99 Pounds in the UK, where it is likely to be launched first. This translates to around Rs 8,800 in India.     Motorola's latest flagships -- Moto Z and Moto Z Force -- are also expected to hit the shelves by September. The Moto Z Force is more powerful out of the two as it has more battery capacity, better rear camera, and features a second-generation Shatter Shield display, the technology which was first seen in Moto X Force.     Both the devices run Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow out-of-the-box, and feature 5.5-inch QHD display. Other common features include a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB RAM and Adreno 530 GPU.
