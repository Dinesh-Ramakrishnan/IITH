  NEW DELHI: How's the view from up there? We are sure it's wonderful!     Gloomy weather aside, things were bright and beautiful in the domestic equity market, as it scaled its one-year high. It seems the bulls on Dalal Street are adamant that it must not fall behind its American peers in hitting a new record high.     The IMD, too, added a bit of sweetener by saying that monsoon is going full throttle all over the country.     Market barometer NSE Nifty50 closed at 8,636, up 1.11 per cent, after hitting a fresh 52-week high during the session while the BSE benchmark Sensex ended 1.05 per cent higher at 28,095.     Here are the stocks and sectors that made headlines in Monday's session.    PSU stocks supercharged:  An ET report suggesting that the Modi government was pondering over creating the mother of all oil firms by merging 13 PSU oil companies got investors all excited on Dalal Street. The BSE CPSE index rallied 1.56 per cent, led by oil marketing companies like IndianOil, MRPL, Chennai Petro, BPCL and HPCL, which gained as much as 11 per cent at close. A Morgan Stanley upgrade of the OMCs aided the rally.       Nifty50 technicals strong:  Trend-tracking indicators such as 'Super Trend' and '5 & 20 EMA' crossovers on the daily charts continue to support the Nifty50 in its pursuit of higher levels. If the momentum continues and the Nifty50 breaches the 8,655 mark convincingly on the upside, the next logical target for the Nifty50 will be around 8,800.       Mandhana rallied after 27 sessions: Mandhana Industries broke free of a staggering losing streak of 27 sessions to rally xx per cent after the Being Human founder Salman Khan was acquitted in his blackbuck hunting case by a Rajasthan court. The company said its was in the process of signing a new contract with Khan's charitable foundation and was negotiating the terms.       221 companies made close to Rs 1,00,000 crore:  As many as 221 companies gained on the BSE on Monday, generating a cumulative Rs 97,756 crore for their investors as the stock rode high on bullish sentiments on Dalal Street. Sahara Housing, Kalyani Steels and Sudarshan Chemicals were among the biggest gainers hitting their respective circuit breakers of 20 per cent.       DRL tanks ahead of Q1 numbers:  One of the top Sensex gainers of the year, Dr Reddy's Labs, is all set to disappoint with its Q1 numbers, said Edelwiess Securities. The brokerage sees weak revenues from Valcyte and Vidaza due to increased competition. The stock tanked 3.62 per cent.
