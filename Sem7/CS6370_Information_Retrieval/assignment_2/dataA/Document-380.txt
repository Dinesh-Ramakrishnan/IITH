Source: Value Research    SHOULD YOU BUY?   This fund has a distinct small-cap positioning and, compared to peers, it has a sharper focus on companies with low market capitalisation. The strict smallcap mandate lends an aggressive profile to this fund. The strategy is to catch tomorrow's large-caps very early. The fund has a reasonably diversified portfolio that does not allow large positions on an one particular company.     For his stock picks, the fund manager tries to take advantage of cyclical upturns in companies and sectors and also prefers niche businesses. The fund has a stellar long-term track record, but its recent performance has seen a dip. Given that the fund manager has proven execution capabilities, investors should give this fund some time to improve its return profile.
