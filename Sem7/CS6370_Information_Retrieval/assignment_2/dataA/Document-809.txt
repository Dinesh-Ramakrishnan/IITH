  NEW DELHI: Amid the GST uproar in Parliament and a fall in global equity markets, the domestic equity market sank into the negative zone on Wednesday.     Investors turned cautious as the Upper House debated the GST (goods and services tax) bill. Asian and European peers hardly offered any support after Wall Street had tanked in overnight trade.     Thus, what was supposed to be a spectacular day on Dalal Street ended up being a disappointing one. The S&P; BSE Sensex opened flat, but quickly lost about 100 points in early trade. The NSE's Nifty50 lost its crucial level of 8,600. Throughout the day, both the equity benchmarks traded with losses.     The Sensex was down about 200 points while the Nifty50 was barely above 8,550 when the GST Bill was tabled. Within one hour of the GST debate in the Rajya Sabha, the 30-share Sensex lost about 300 points and the broader Nifty50 broke below 8,550. The 30-stock pack finally closed at 27,697, down 284 points or 1.02 per cent, while the Nifty50 settled at 8,544, down 78 points or 0.91 per cent.     The broader market declined in line with the benchmarks with the BSE Midcap index losing 1.50 per cent and the Smallcap index 1.14 per cent. Only six out of 30 Sensex stocks ended in the green: Among them were Asian Paints (up 2.04 per cent), Cipla (up 1.81 per cent), Sun Pharma (up 1.12 per cent), Coal India (up 0.51 per cent), Bharti Airtel (up 0.25 per cent) and Infosys (up 0.06 per cent).     At the bottom of the Sensex pack were Tata Motors (down 2.98 per cent), ITC (down 2.86 per cent), Maruti (down 2.32 per cent), Power Grid Corporation (down 1.93 per cent) and Reliance Industries (down 1.75 per cent).     Experts believe the market action will be driven by the GST outcome from here on. "We have had a very good show last month. The market was really strong and now as we head into the GST debate, the GST rate becomes the key. Is it going to be 18 per cent or 20 per cent? Eighteen per cent is positive, 20 per cent is negative, and so these details now become the next leg to determine where the market goes from here," said Chakri Lokapriya, CIO & MD, TCG AMC.     13 out of 15 logistics stocks tanked due to GST-related worries.     Realty, power, FMCG, auto and energy stocks ended deep in the red, with the BSE Realty index losing the most at 2.15 per cent.     Among specific stocks, Bharat Financial Inclusion fell 2.39 per cent with the stock extending Tuesday's losses triggered by the arrest of the company's CFO S Dilli Raj.     HCL Tech ended 3.16 per cent higher after it reported Q1 PAT at Rs 2,047 crore vs Rs 1,926 crore, up 6.28 per cent QoQ.     EIH fell as much as 3.92 per cent in morning trade after the hospitality major, which runs hotels and resorts under Oberoi and Trident brands, posted a net loss at Rs 12.24 crore for the June quarter.     Elsewhere in Asia, China's Shanghai Composite ended 0.24 per cent higher while Japan's Nikkei lost 1.88 per cent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng 1.76 per cent.     At the time of writing of this report, London's FTSE100 was down 0.20 per cent and France's CAC40 0.31 per cent but Germany's DAX was trading 0.04 per cent higher.
