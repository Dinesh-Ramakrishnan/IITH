 NEW DELHI:  Global brokerage firms such as Citigroup, CLSA, Morgan Stanley and BofA-ML in separate notes to clients have maintained their buy or equal weight rating on these top five Nifty50 stocks, which can deliver up 20 per cent return in next one year.     The Nifty50 index has rallied around 800 points from 7,927 to 8,728 level and is making higher lows in the last seven consecutive weeks, which suggests strong momentum.     However last week, it witnessed a correction of 188 points from 8,728 to 8,540, but this profit booking decline was being bought and it managed to continue its major trend by heading towards 8,700 zone, experts said.     "The index needs to cross and hold above 8,700-8,720 level to start the next move towards 8,844 and then towards 9,000 levels," Chandan Taparia, Derivative & Technical Analyst at Anand Rathi said.     "Overall, the trend may remain intact to positive till it holds above 8,550 level, but a fresh move would br triggered once it manages to hold above 8,700-8,720 zone," he said.     Top global brokerage firms have maintained their buy or equal weight ratings on these top 5 Nifty50 stocks post their June quarter results:     Hindalco: Buy | Target price Rs 170    Citigroup has maintains buy rating on Hindalco post-June quarter results and has also upgraded its target price to Rs 170 from Rs 120 earlier.     The global investment bank raised its consolidated Ebitda by 14 per cent, 12 per cent for FY17 and FY18 respectively on higher prices and lower costs. Hindalco trades at 6.5x September 2017 EV/Ebitda compared with global peers at 5-10x. Going forward capacity additions should re-set price optimism on the stock, said the Citigroup note.    Bank of Baroda: Buy | Target price Rs 175    CLSA has upgraded Bank of Baroda to buy from outperform earlier post the June quarter results. It has also raised its 12-month target price to Rs 175 from Rs 170 earlier.     The asset quality was weak with annualised slippages still at 6 per cent of past year loans. The company is realigning loan mix towards higher return on asset (ROA) segments by pruning overseas working capital loans.     CLSA sees scope to improve net interest margin (NIM) by changing loan mix to higher ROA segments. The global investment bank is of the view that that BoB is better placed than most PSUs given lower net NPL ratio and better capitalisation.    Sun Pharma: Equal weight l Target price Rs 846    Morgan Stanley maintains equal weight rating on Sun Pharma post June quarter results but raised its 12-month target price to Rs 846 from Rs 805 earlier. The global investment bank is of the view that the stock is fully priced for 2 year forward earnings per share (EPS).     The company is on track to achieve $300m in synergy benefits from the Ranbaxy, said the Morgan Stanley note. Sun Pharma which launched its generic Gleevec in February lifted profits in the June quarter but the impact will moderate hereon due to new competition.    The stock should trade in Rs 750-850 range in the next 12 months.    State Bank of India: Buy| Target price Rs 300    BofA-ML has maintained buy rating on SBI post June quarter results but raised its 12-month target price to Rs 300 from Rs 265 earlier. The sharp improvement in the asset quality was the biggest highlight of June quarter earnings.     The slippages reduced drastically across all segments such as agriculture, retail, corporate and SME segments. The global investment bank marginally slashed its FY18 slippages estimates by 5-7 per cent.     BofA-ML expects earnings growth to touch 27 per cent, 43 per cent through FY17 and FY18 respectively on strong volumes.
