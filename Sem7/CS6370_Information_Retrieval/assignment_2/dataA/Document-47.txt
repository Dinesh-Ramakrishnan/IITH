  MUMBAI: Inox Leisure, the second largest cinema exhibitor in India after PVR, has entered into agreements with real estate developers and upcoming shopping malls to expand its presence.     The Mumbai headquartered multiplex player will be spending close to Rs 800 crore in the next 3-4 years to add 62 new properties with 312 screens to take its total screen count to 737.     The company has aggressively added three screens every month on an average in the last 10 years, mainly through acquisitions. It started the consolidation wave in the multiplex industry with acquisitions of Calcutta Cine in 2007, and later picked up Fame India in May 2013 and Satyam Cineplex in August 2014.    Alok Tandon, CEO at Inox Leisure, feels the time for inorganic expansion in the multiplex industry is over after the recent acquisition of DLF's DT Cinemas by rival PVR."There are not many good properties left," Tandon told ET. "Moreover, today we have got a strong organic pipeline for growth." The company , which currently operates 425 screens across 108 properties in 57 cities, will be spending anywhere between Rs 2-2.5 crore per screen for the new properties.     Meanwhile, Inox has no plans to raise any funds. "We have a very strong and healthy balance sheet.Our debt-equity ratio is only 0.4.We won't need to raise funds as our internal accruals will take care of the requirements," Tandon said.
