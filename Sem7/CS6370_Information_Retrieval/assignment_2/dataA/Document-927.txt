  NEW DELHI: Shares of 13 BSE companies have lost up to one-third of their market value since July 1, even as the companies reported up to 30 per cent jump in bottom lines and up to 289 per cent surge in top lines.     Data available with corporate database Capitaline showed these stocks belonged to pharma, textiles and IT sectors and also included a few credit rating agencies.     The biggest fall was seen by Rajesh Exports, which has fallen 36.34 per cent since July 1, even as company reported a 13.81 per cent YoY rise in net profit at Rs 270 crore on a 289 per cent YoY surge in net sales at Rs 58,917 crore.     Shares of Tata Elxsi have slumped 27.43 per cent this earnings season despite a 17.4 per cent YoY jump in net profit on a 21 per cent YoY rise in top line. Brokerage Motilal Oswal expects the company to post 24 per cent revenue growth CAGR and 28 per cent PAT growth CAGR over FY16-18.     "Given its strong set of capabilities built over the past 25 years in areas of technology, engineering and design and its standing as a strong play in IoT (internet of things) services, we recommend a buy rating on the stock with a price target of Rs 1,965, which is 24 times FY18E EPS," the brokerage said.    Sintex shares have fallen from Rs 100 to Rs 70. The company has reported a net profit growth of 11.45 per cent for June quarter on a 16.48 per cent growth in net sales. The scrip turned ex-rights issue on August 9.     Two drugmakers, Suven Lifesciences and Strides Shasun, have fallen 24 per cent and 21 per cent, respectively, since July 1.     "Compared with last year, the growth is much better this quarter. But compared with last quarter, it is down. The growth for the year will normalise at around 20 per cent compared with last year's," Suven Life Science Chairman & CEO Venkat Jasti told ETNow last week.        Strides Shashun reported its quarterly numbers this past week. Despite reporting double-digit growth in sales and profit, the company failed to live up to the mark. Credit Suisse has maintained an 'outperform' rating on the stock, but cut the target price to Rs 1,235 from Rs 1,420, factoring in a 30 per cent/22 per cent drop in 2017/18 earnings estimates on active pharmaceuticals ingredients (API) and delayed synergies.     Shares of Astrazeneca Pharma , Lupin and Capil Point Lab have tanked 14 per cent each this earnings season. These companies have reported up to 290 per cent YoY rise in net profit on up to 55 per cent rise in sales.     Shares of rating agencies ICRA and CARE, textiles major Arvind and IT hardware company Redington have slumped up to 18 per cent this result season. They have reported up to 55 per cent rise in profits and up to 41 per cent YoY growth in sales.
