  NEW DELHI: The government today said that around 17 lakh tonne of e-waste was generated in the country in 2014 and it has notified E-Waste rules in March this year to ensure better management of such wastes.     Based on a survey carried out by the Central Pollution Control Board in 2005, the generation of e-waste in the country was assessed at 1.46 lakh tonne and was estimated to exceed 8 lakh tonne by 2012.     "As per the United Nations University report, 17 lakh tonnes of e-waste was generated in the country in 2014," Environment Minister Anil Madhav Dave said in a written reply in Rajya Sabha.     He said that at present, there are 151 registered e-waste dismantlers and recyclers in private sectors in 13 states in the country having combined capacity of 4.46 lakh metric tonne per annum.     He said that his Ministry has comprehensively revised e-waste (Management & handling) Rules, 2011 and notified e-Waste (Management) Rules in March, 2016.     The provisions of this Rule include expanding producer's responsibility under Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), setting up of producer responsibility organizations and e-waste exchange to facilitate collection and recycling amongst others.     It also includes assigning specific responsibility to bulk consumers of electronic products for safe disposal and providing for economic incentives for collection of electronic waste, he said.     "Directions have been issued under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 to Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board, Delhi Pollution Control Committee and to District Magistrate of Moradabad in UP for immediate closure of all illegal and unauthorized e-Waste recycling units operating in Loni, Behta, Hajipur and Rahul Garden area of Uttar Pradesh, Mandoli and Seemapuri areas of Delhi and Moradabad in UP respectively," Dave said.
