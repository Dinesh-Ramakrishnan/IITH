  KOLKATA: Bharti Airtel on Thursday launched its 4G services in Kharagpur, which is part of the West Bengal circle and home to one of the premier Indian Institutes of Technology.     India's No 1 carrier will enable 4G customers in Kharagpur to enjoy uninterrupted HD video streaming, superfast uploading and downloading of movies, music and images, the company said in an official statement.    Airtel 4G is available to customers across a range of smart devices including mobile phones, 4G hotspots and dongles. Customers can enjoy Airtel 4G at the price of Airtel 3G and customers will have the option of choosing from a host of attractive tariff packs.     Airtel 4G in Kharagpur has been rolled out using dual spectrum bands of 2300 MHz and 1800 MHz. The combination of such TD LTE and FD LTE ensures higher network capacity, which translates into a superior customer experience. This makes Kharagpur amongst the few cities to have an integrated dual band 4G network.     "We are delighted to roll out our 4G services in Kharagpur. Customers can look forward to a superlative smartphone experience with Airtel 4G and enjoy superfast access speeds. We invite all data savvy customers to upgrade to Airtel 4G and be a part of India's widest 4G network," said Ravindra Singh Negi, CEO - West Bengal & Odisha, Bharti Airtel.     Airtel had launched India's first 4G network in Kolkata in April 2012. To avail the complimentary 4G upgrade, existing Airtel customers with 4G-ready devices can walk into their nearest Airtel Store and switch to a 4G SIM.
