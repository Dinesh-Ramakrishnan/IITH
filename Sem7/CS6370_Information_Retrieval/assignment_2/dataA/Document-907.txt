  NEW DELHI: Call it a technical breakdown, disappointment from RBI policy review or profit taking. The fact is market valuations are turning toppish and, apparently, investors are taking it too seriously.     The editor and publisher of Gloom, Boom & Doom Report, Marc Faber, has an interesting take on Indian equities, when he says he would still bet on India over the US.     But, who cares? Investors sold stocks on Thursday. That is what it is.    Benchmark equity indices lost over 1 per cent during the day, even as global markets and Dow futures traded sideways with a positive bias. The interest rate-sensitive stocks were partly to blame, so was a COAI report suggesting that Reliance's telecom arm was offering full-fledged services to its users in name of 'tests'.     The Sensex declined 310.28 points to settle at 27,774. The Nifty50 slipped below the 8,600 level to close at 8,575, down 1.19 per cent. Both the indices recorded their biggest intraday fall since June 24.     Here is a wrapup of the major trends across stocks and sectors that hogged limelight during the session:    Smallcaps led broadbased selling:  Those who believe the fall in the market was concentrated in largecaps, think again. Of the 2,840 BSE-listed stocks that traded for the day, 1,899 ended in the red. The BSE Smallcap index lost 1.18 per cent for the day against a 1.10 per cent fall in the BSE Sensex.       NPAs haunted banking stocks:  Canara Bank slumped 4.23 per cent to Rs 250.35. Bank of India, PNB, IndusInd Bank and ICICI Bank fell 4.12 per cent, 3.59 per cent, 2.63 per cent and 2.49 per cent, respectively. But Yes Bank and Bank of Baroda bucked the trend to rise up to 1 per cent. The index ended 1.51 per cent lower at 18,647. Poor asset quality and losses reported by some of the lenders hurt sentiment on the banking counter.   Live chart here       Grasim, AB Nuvo plunged on $11 billion clarification:  Shares of Grasim Industries slumped 6.10 per cent to Rs 4,851.50, while AB Nuvo fell 4.07 per cent to Rs 1,512.75 after the two companies clarified that their boards were not considering a merger of the two companies, which could potentially form an $11 billion giant.   Live chart here       AstraZeneca soared on upbeat Q1 Nos:  Shares of pharma MNC AstraZeneca Pharma India jumped 3.39 per cent to Rs 1,044 after the company reported a three-times surge in June quarter profit. The subsidiary of the British-Swedish pharma company reported a net profit of Rs 10.6 crore for June quarter, compared with Rs 2.7 crore profit reported for the corresponding quarter last year.   Live chart here       Lupin slid on brokerage calls:  Shares of Lupin fell 3.89 per cent to Rs 1,545.05 after a foreign brokerage downgraded the stock on weak outlook. Among them was CLSA, which lowered the target price for the stock to Rs 1,500 from Rs 1,740 earlier.   Live chart here       Spurt in open interest: Motherson Sumi saw the highest rise in open interest (OI) at 42.37 per cent. The stock fell 6.42 per cent during the day. A rise in open interest (OI) along with a fall in the stock price suggests short buildup, which is not considered a positive trend. Tata Chemicals, Tata Communications and M&M; witnessed up to 40 per cent surge in OI. Tata Chemicals soared 9.47 per cent and Tata Communications 6.29 per cent, while M&M; lost 2.3 per cent. A rise in open interest and price is seen as a positive trend.       Most active scrips of the day  : Lupin (trading volume Rs 564 crore), Adani Ports (trading volume Rs 497 crore), M&M; (trading volume Rs 482 crore), Motherson Sumi (trading volume Rs 472 crore) and SBI (trading volume Rs 379 crore) were the most active stocks on NSE in terms of traded value during the session.
