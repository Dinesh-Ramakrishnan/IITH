 NEW DELHI: The S&P; BSE Sensex pared gains after rallying nearly 90 points in the morning trade on Friday, led by gains in SBI, Infosys, Axis Bank, L&T;, and Tata Motors.     The Nifty50 was trading above its crucial support level of 8,650 supported by gains in realty, power, oil & gas, metal, banks and capital goods stocks.     At 09:20 am, the 30-share index was trading at 28,149.71, up 26 points or 0.09 per cent. It touched a high of 28,212.30 and a low of 28,143.24 in morning trade.     The Nifty50 was trading at 8,678 up 5 points or 0.06 per cent. It touched a high of 8,696.60 and a low of 8,678.40 in the first 30 minutes of trade.     "Increasing possibility of a higher-than-expected final GST rate and deliberations on whether the rollout would be advisable with several states going into elections next year have raised the odds of GST missing the April 2017 deadline, which may cap the gains in the market," said Anand James, Chief Market Strategist, Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services.     The S&P; BSE Midcap Index was up 0.25 per cent and BSE S&P; Smallcap Index was trading 0.32 per cent higher.     SBI (up 2.8 per cent), Infosys (up 1.2 per cent), Cipla (up 0.84 per cent), Wipro (up 0.76 per cent), and ONGC (up 0.64 per cent) were the major Sensex gainers.     Power Grid (down 1.07 per cent), HDFC (down 0.84 per cent), HDFC Bank (down 0.7 per cent) and RIL (down 0.61 per cent) were the major Sensex losers.     Here are a couple of factors influencing the market sentiment:    Adopt buy on dips strategy:  Experts pointed out that the Nifty50 broke out of a three-day consolidation on Thursday and formed a bullish 'mat and hold' pattern.     "The index consolidated in a broad range of 8,680 on higher side and 8,590 on the downside. It has made a short white candlestick and a bullish 'mat and hold' pattern. In near term, the bias will be in favour of the bulls, with a closing above the 8,664 level. From here on, a buy-on-dips strategy should work well for targets of 8,740-8,840," said Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research.    FPI flows, earnings to influence sentiment:  Oberoi Realty, Claris Lifesciences, National Fertilizers, Ramson Projects and a couple of other companies will announce their June quarter earnings during the day.     Tata Power, Just Dial, HPCL, NTPC and TVS Srichakra would be among companies reporting earnings during the week.     "The Q1 results have been a mixed bag so far," brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher said in a note. "We expect the banks to lead the table with 18.9 per cent earnings growth for the Nifty50 in FY17," it said.     Data available with NSDL showed foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have bought equities worth Rs 7,486 crore so far this month.    Asian markets open strong:  Most Asian markets were trading higher this morning. Japan's benchmark Nikkei added 0.5 per cent and South Korea's Kospi tacked on 0.2 per cent while Australian shares added 0.1 per cent.    China's CSI300 was down 3.72 points at 3,200. Other Asian indices, including Hong Kong's Hang Seng (up 0.57 per cent) and Taiwan's TWSE (up 0.49 per cent) were trading higher.    US markets rose on Thursday:  The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 23.76 points, or 0.13 per cent, to close at 18,597.7 in overnight trade, while the S&P; 500 added 4.8 points, or 0.22 per cent, to 2,187.02 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 11.49 points, or 0.22 per cent, to 5,240.15, Reuters reported.
