  Gurgaon-based IT professional Pallavi Sharma has a very tax friendly income. Taxspanner estimates that if her employer contributes to the New Pension System (NPS) on her behalf, Sharma's tax can come down by almost Rs 7,000. Up to 10% of the basic salary put in the NPS is tax deductible under Sec 80CCD(2d).     Another way the NPS can help Sharma save tax is through the new Sec 80CCD(1b). She should reduce her PPF investment to Rs 1 lakh and put the balance Rs 50,000 in the NPS. This will reduce her tax by Rs 10,300.     Before she commits money to NPS, Sharma should remember that it will get locked up till she turns 60. She will also be expected to contribute at least Rs 6,000 to her NPS account every year. If she fails to invest every year, there will be a penalty.     Sharma needs to make drastic changes in her tax planning investments. Three months ago, she was sold a Ulip in the garb of an SIP. While the click2invest Ulip is a low-cost product, its short-term horizon of five years will not allow Sharma to make money. If she stops paying the premium, the money already put in the policy will be returned to her after five years with a 4% return.
