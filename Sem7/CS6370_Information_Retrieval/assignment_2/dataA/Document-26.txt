  NEW DELHI: Operations have been suspended at a bottling plant of Coca-Cola India at Dasna in Uttar Pradesh after state authorities alleged environmental violations by the company.     Confirming receipt of notice from Uttar Pradesh State Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), the company said it has submitted a detailed response to issues raised over the plant.     "Since UPPCB is reviewing the response, to show our commitment to compliance with regulatory norms, we decide to temporarily suspend manufacturing at Dasna plant," Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages Pvt Ltd (HCCBL) said in a statement.     Hindustan Coca Cola Beverages is the bottling arm of Coca-Cola India.     The company, however, insisted that all of its "plants operate in full compliance with all regulatory norms and Dasna plant is no exception".     Earlier this year, HCCBL had suspended manufacturing at three locations in India citing absence of "long-term economic viability".     The company has suspended manufacturing at Kaladera near Jaipur (Rajasthan), Vishakhapatnam (Andhra Pradesh) and Brynihat (Meghalaya).     HCCBL has 24 bottling plants at strategic locations in various states spread across India and covers approximately 65 per cent of bottling operations for the Coca-Cola System in India.
