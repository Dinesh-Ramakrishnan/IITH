  NEW DELHI: Micromax,India's No 2 smartphone player is expecting TVs to make up 15 per cent of its overall revenue by March 2017, as it aims to capture the third spot in the television market.     The new entrant is aiming for a 12 per cent share of the market by the fiscal end, up from 9 per cent it holds at present which puts the brand at fourth position amid competition from Samsung, Sony and LG in the LED television space, and newer players like LeEco.     "We're targeting a minimum of Rs 1500 crore as revenue from TVs which will be about 15 per cent of our total revenue, up from 11 per cent at present," chief marketing officer Shubhajit Sen said, on the sidelines of launching smart TVs Wednesday.     TV business raked in Rs 1,000 crore in the fiscal ended March this year.     The Smart TV range will be available on Flipkart in 32, 40 and 50 inch screens starting from Rs 19,999, Rs 29,999 and Rs 42,999, respectively.     The newly launched TV range takes the total total TV portfolio of the company to 18 models. The company expects to sell about 12.5 lakh TV units this fiscal year, up from 8.5 lakh last year.     Micromax is targeting urban centres with locally made, competitively priced smart TV that go on sale on Flipkart from August 14, while pre-bookings begin today.     "We are excited to be the online platform for consumers amidst the technological transformation of home entertainment to provide them with a fulfilling and affordable shopping experience," Sandeep Karwa, Head of TV & Large Appliances, Flipkart said. About 15 per cent of the company's TV sales come from online.     Micromax's Sen said that the company was evaluating selling the smart TVs in the offline market, but is yet to take a decision.
