 By Nathan Mcalone    Apps are more powerful than ever, but it's hard to know which ones will waste your time and which ones will save it. That's why we've assembled a list of apps that will make you more productive, and take away some of the stress from your life.     Workflow is a powerful way to save time by automating your life    Workf low lets you customise your phone so that you can skip time-wasting tasks. By telling your phone what to do when it notices a certain action, you can instruct your phone to call an Uber before your next calendar appointment, upload your latest photo to Twitter and virtually any other string of actions you can think of.   Price:  $2.99 (iOS)    Polymail is an email app that gives you features without compromising simplicity    Polymail gives you things like email tracking and the ability to read and send later. But the best part is its simple design.   Price:  Free (iOS)    Paper by Fifty Three combines sketching and writing    Paper for iPhone is an app that expands the notion of what 'taking notes' means on your phone. You can use it to make everything from lists to presentations that include charts and graphs.

Price:  Free (iOS)    Pocket lets you save articles to read offline later â on any device    It's easy to forget to come back to an article you want to read when you're furiously browsing the internet.

Price:  $4.99 (iOS)    Google Keep jazzes up your notes    Google Keep is a bit like Google's version of Evernote, and it's now available on both iOS and Android. You can use the app to take notes, jot down to-do lists, set reminders and record audio. And one of its main charms is the ability to organise your notes with coloured labels.
