  NEW DELHI: Pakistan has the history of supporting terror in the region amid which Bangladesh and India have launched counter-propaganda against the region's fundamentalist forces encouraged by the ISI-Jammat-e-Islami nexus, according to Bangladesh Information Minister Hasanal Haq Inu.     "Pakistan has a poor track-record. Islamabad harbours terrorism and it has lot to answer. Terrorism in Bangladesh is the legacy of the 1971 war when Pakistan and its local collaborator Jamaat-e-Islami tried to deny fundamental rights of the people of then East Pakistan. Time has arrived for Islamabad to decide if it wants to continue in the democratic club," Inu told ET on Friday here in what would bolster India's recent assertions against Pak sponsored crossborder terror.     The senior Bangladeshi minister is in Delhi as part of multi-dimensional approach by India and Bangladesh to combat terrorism in the backdrop of July 1 attack in the posh Dhaka locality that mostly killed foreigners.     The Bangladesh Home Minister visited India in July to expand counter-terror partnership and this is followed by a visit by Inu who met his Indian counterpart Venkaiah Naidu earlier this week to explore various elements of a joint propaganda including films and documentaries to counter fundamentalism and extremism.
