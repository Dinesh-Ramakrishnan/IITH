  Mutual fund queries answered by Amol Joshi, Founder, PlanRupee Investment Services.    I am 51-year old. I have a corpus of around Rs 51 lakh, consisting of equity MF and PPF. What should be my corpus at the age of 61 to get an income of Rs 18 lakh pa at current value? And which schemes to invest in SIP for better and regular returns over the next 10 yrs? -- Nandkumar Gajria    Since you have mentioned 'at current value', let's first arrive at that value. With assumption of 6% inflation throughout, Rs 18 lakh of today will be about Rs 32.25 lakh 10 years from now. Next, we need to know for how long you need that income. In other words, we need to know life expectancy to run calculations and arrive at numbers. Since life expectancy is not mentioned, we will work with assumption that income is required for 15 years post age of 61. This amount of annual income can be derived from a corpus of ~Rs. 4.00 crore with return expectations of 8%. The required corpus reduces to ~ Rs. 3.65 cr with 9% return expectation. The corpus exhausts after 15 years.     Regarding SIPs, you can expect 'regular returns' from Debt (Fixed Income)-oriented mutual funds. However, since you are also looking for 'better' returns and that the horizon is 10 years, equity-oriented hybrid funds, also known as balanced funds, are a suitable choice. balanced funds qualify for equity taxation. You can invest in HDFC Balanced Fund & Birla Sun Life Balanced 95 fund.    I have invested Rs.80000 each in the year 2012-13 and 2015-16 in ELSS scheme on behalf of my son who is 26 years of age. I want to invest Rs. 80000/00 ELSS for the year 2016-17 also. Please advise me some good ELSS funds. Further, is it advisable to hold all the ELSS till his retirement ? If not, please advise the measures to be undertaken.-- Prakash Watwe    For the current year's ELSS allocation, you can invest in Reliance Tax Saver Fund & ICICI Prudential Long Term Equity Fund. Regarding the question if the ELSS can be held till retirement, yes, your son can hold ELSS investment folio till his retirement since ELSS schemes by composition are diversified equity schemes. However, it is recommended that ELSS investments need not exceed Rs. 1.50 lakh/year (current Section 80C limit). Any excess funds can be invested in open-ended diversified equity funds where the liquidity/redemption option is available before 3 years and money is not locked-in.    I am 20 and I would like to begin my investment in mutual funds through SIPs. I would want to hold the money for a medium term of 3-5 years to fund my higher education. The SIP amount of Rs.500 per month would be suitable. Which funds would be the best for investment through SIP considering my needs? - Priyanka Chandak    If you intend to invest Rs. 500/month via SIP for 3 to 5 years, you can look at Franklin India Balanced Fund. Over 3 years your total investment would be Rs. 18,000 and it may grow to Rs. 21,000 at estimated growth rate of 12%. These amounts would change to Rs. 30,000/- & Rs. 41,000/- respectively for 5 years. You may re-work investment amount in line with amount that will be required for your stated financial goal, i.e. higher education.    My name is Naved Anwar and I am 31 years old. I have started investing in ICICI Value Discovery Fund through the SIP mode for a horizon of 20-25 years with a target of 50 lakh. SIP amount is 1000 and it will increase every year 10%. The second fund for tax saving purpose is Axis Long Term Equity Fund with same horizon and the same amount of SIP. Have I chosen the right fund for investment purpose? Please guide me. - Naved Anwar    Yes, you have chosen right funds. Since the investment horizon is 20-25 years, an equity fund is suitable in terms of growth potential as well tax efficiency. Your choice of funds is proper. However, you will have to monitor the performance of funds periodically vis-a-vis their benchmark.
