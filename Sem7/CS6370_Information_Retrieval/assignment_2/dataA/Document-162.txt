  NEW DELHI: Telecom operator Reliance Communications today launched a new scheme for its 3G and 4G customers that it claims will make calling from mobile applications 95 per cent cheaper.     "We are excited to redefine voice calling in India by introducing the 'Calling Ka Naya Tareeka', offering app-to-app talking in India, and anywhere in the world using our next-generation 4G LTE network," said Gurdeep Singh, RComm CEO (Consumer Business), today said.     The company has priced 200 megabyte of 4G data at Rs 39 which can be used for making 300 minutes of phone call using mobile applications like JioChat, WhatsApp, FB Messenger, Skype, Google Hangouts and the like.     "Under any other 3G or 4G scheme, per minute calls from mobile applications will cost Rs 2-3, but under this scheme, it will cost around 13 paise," Singh said.     He said data being given under the scheme can be used for accessing any website and listening to online music, but the plan scheme is designed in a manner that will make calls from the mobile application cheaper.     "Using our 4G LTE network, customers will experience HD quality and instant connectivity, freedom from slow Internet access and blazing data speeds on the digital superhighway," Singh said.
