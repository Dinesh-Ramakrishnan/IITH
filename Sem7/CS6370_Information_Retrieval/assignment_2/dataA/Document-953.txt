  Mumbai: Dilip Buildcon made a firm debut on the bourses on Thursday with the stock closing 16 per cent above its issue price of Rs 219. The stock, which listed at a near 10 per cent premium over its initial public offer (IPO) price, closed at Rs 254.5 on Thursday.     Analysts recommend selling the stock as it may not sustain gains in case of a stock market decline. The Rs 664-crore IPO of Dilip Buildcon (DBL) was subscribed almost 21 times led by strong appetite from rich investors.     "Ideally, if any investor finds it an opportunity to book profits, he could do it at this time," said Santosh Yellapu, analyst, Angel Broking. "My sense is based on the recent IPOs that got listed in the infra space, we don't find such premium listings sustain for a longer period of time," he said.     Analysts said valuations of Dilip Buildcon are in line with that of its peers such as KNR Constructions. The stock is trading at a price to earnings ratio of 17.5 times 2015-16 earnings as against 15.5 times of KNR.        But, KNR's order book is healthier, said analysts. "The order book for KNR is Rs 4,600 crore, which is five times its FY16 revenue. This is much healthier than the DBL's order book of Rs 10,800 crore, which 2.6 times of its FY16 revenue," said Binod Modi, analyst, Reliance Securities.     Dilip Buildcon's order book also consisted of some unexecuted orders, which needed more equity of Rs 350-400 crore. In comparison, KNR Constructions has no such associated equity risks, said Modi. "I don't see the stock (Dilip Buildcon) going up substantially or any large correction to happen, below IPO levels. If and when the stock comes around IPO levels the investor can enter it for a long term," said Yellapu.
