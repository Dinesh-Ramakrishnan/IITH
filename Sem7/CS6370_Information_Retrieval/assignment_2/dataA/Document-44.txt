He joins Carnival Cinemas from Everstone Capital Advisors, where he was overlooking the consumer facing businesses of the company.     Prior to Everstone, Arora has spent 18 years at PVR Cinemas and has been instrumental in making the Ajay Bijli-promoted multiplex firm to be India's largest cinema exhibition company as its group president.     Arora has also served as COO at Oberoi Realty.    Shrikant Bhasi, chairman, Carnival Group, saidm "I am extremely confident in Pramod's capabilities and am positive that he will add immense value to our cinema business. He will play a pivotal role in ensuring that we accomplish Carnival's vision of 1000 screens by 2017."     Arora added, "My mandate is to fast track growth of Carnival Cinemas and make Carnival Cinemas one of the most preferred brands in India and I am confident that we will execute our plans well."     Carnival Cinemas has made three acquisitions in the past - Anil Ambani's Big Cinemas, Network18's Glitz Cinemas, and HDIL's multiplex chain Broadway Cinema - to become third largest multiplex company in India in terms of number of screens.
