  Those averse to volatility are advised to go light on investments in the next few weeks and instead focus on select stocks that will come into play as the earning season unfolds from Monday with IndusInd Bank. Also, mark some money for investing in offers for sale (OFS), as the government is likely to ramp up its disinvestment plans.    RAJESH PALVIYA HEAD - TECHNICAL & DERIVATIVES ANALYST, AXIS SECURITIES   Where are We?  On the weekly chart, Nifty manages to hold above 61.80% Fibonacci retracement level 8243 (from 9119 to 6825 level) for second consecutive week, indicating that it is gaining strength. The daily and weekly strength indicator RSI is moving upwards and above its reference line indicating positive bias. Overall bullishness to persist.    What is in Store?  Nifty consolidated in the range of 8400-8300 last week and has formed small bearish candle which indicates small profi t booking at higher levels. If it manages to break out above the crucial level of 8390 decisively, then we may see a sharp up-move towards 8440-8500 in the short term. Nifty is expected to trade in broader range of 8150-8600 in the coming weeks with bullish bias.    What Investors Could Do?  Nifty forms higher high-low formation on monthly and weekly charts which indicates that it is gaining strength. Chart pattern suggests 8390 and 8440 are very important resistance levels, hence some profi t booking action may take place near this resistance area. We advise to buy stocks if Nifty corrects in near/short term to 8200-8100.    AK PRABHAKAR HEAD OF RESEARCH, IDBI CAPITAL MARKET   Nifty Marching Towards 8600-8750  Nifty corrected till 7927 and then fresh rally started making high of 8398 and now we have scaled up our target to 8600-8750. Nifty's uptrend is getting stronger and till 8040 is held on lower side, any correction is just an opportunity to buy.    Things to Watch  Result season starts with IndusInd Bank result on Monday followed by TCS & Infosys in the coming week. Parliament session is starting on July 18, and any positive development on GST can benefi t auto, FMCG, logistics.Most on the street perceive may pending bills can be passed in this session.    What Could Investor Do?  Investors should stay with good growth stocks. We are entering into blow-out phase where few stocks' rally can surprise market. We like stocks like Hero MotoCorp, Sundram Fasteners, Sintex Industries, Repco Home Finance, NBCC, Power Grid, Shriram Transport Finance Company, Himatsingka Seide Limited, Arvind and Mahindra Holidays & Resorts for reasonable gains in next 1-2 months.    ANAND JAMES CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, GEOJIT BNP PARIBAS FINANCIAL SERVICES   Where are We?  Having retraced 62% of the fall from 2015's peaks, which in itself is a positive sign, reluctance is seen to push ahead. The breathtaking rallies seen in the last weeks of May and June 2016 suggest that the greed quotient is still present and that more expansive rallies are in store.    What is in Store?  8400, that had kept a lid on upsides last week, could continue to be so for a while longer, but downside moves are less likely to be directional, and are favoured to be limited to 8050, or, 7700 from a worst case scenario. Meanwhile, a break above 8400 barrier need not be followed by directional moves, and favoured view expects such initial forays above 8400 could see pull backs, and be dominated by volatility.    What Could You Do?  Those averse to volatility are advised to go light on investments in the next few weeks, and instead focus on select stocks that will come into play as the earning season unfolds. Also, mark some money for investing into OFS, as government is likely to step its disinvestment plans.     Bull spread option strategy can be used if Nifty were to slip into the 8200- 8050 in the coming weeks.
