  Pankaj Salve had a dream: to have information about the Mumbai local at his fingertips. The Mumbaikar, who used to commute on local trains, used to be frustrated by delays and lack of information. "While one can get information about express trains, there was no way of knowing when a local will hit a station," says Salve, 36.     In January last year, he met Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu, who liked the idea of a toll-free service for commuters. After tying up with the Railways, Salve launched, with cofounder Deepa Sohani, a toll-free service, Mobitip for Central Railway, last year; and for Western Railway in April this year. He pooled Rs 20 lakh from his savings and loans from friends. Now, all one has to do to get an SMS alert on the current status of a train is to give a missed call to the toll-free number.      Caste was a brutal reality in college, he says. That he was a Dalit was not lost on his classmates. "They said I made it to college only on the basis of reservation. I chose to ignore the taunts â can I change my caste?"     Salve did his master's in management studies and worked with companies like Standard Chartered, Tata AMC and JM Financial.     With his salaried days behind him, Salve has to think about how his service can generate revenue. He relies on SMS advertising and insists that making money is not a priority for now. "I am more focused on building a large user base," he says. With 5 lakh calls already logged and 1.5 lakh unique users, he seems well on track.
