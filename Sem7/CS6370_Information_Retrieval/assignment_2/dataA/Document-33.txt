  NEW DELHI: Tata Power's 50:50 joint venture with Exxaro Resources in South Africa, Cennergi (Pty) announced commencement of commercial operations for its 95 MW Tsitsikamma Community wind farm project on Thursday.     "The said wind farm comprises 31 3.075 MW Vestas-make turbines," Tata Power said in a press statement today.     According to the statement, Cennergi was picked as the preferred bidder for two wind projects under the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme of the South African government.     With the commissioning of the Tsitsikamma project, Cennergi's operational portfolio has increased to 229 MW as it achieved commercial operations of its 134 MW Amakhala Emoyeni wind project last month.     Tata Power CEO and MD Anil Sardana said, "Our successful partnership with Exxaro represented a significant move towards augmenting our global footprint and resulting in Cennergi becoming a preferred bidder for two wind projects."     The commissioning of the Tsitsikamma project has bolstered Tata Power's renewable portfolio outside India and shows its commitment to enhancing non-fossil based generation portfolio up to 30-40 per cent of its total generating capacity and creating value for stakeholders, the firm said.     Tata Power, an integrated power company, together with its subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities has an installed gross generation capacity of 9,184 MW and presence in all segments of the power sector.
