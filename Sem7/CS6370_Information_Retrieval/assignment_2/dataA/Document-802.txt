  NEW DELHI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on expected lines kept the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent at its third Bi-monthly Monetary Policy meet on Tuesday, but flagged off upside risks to inflation.     The central bank also kept the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL), and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 7.0 per cent.     Risks to the inflation target of 5 per cent for March 2017 continue to be on the upside, said the RBI statement. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and will continue to emphasise the adequate provision of liquidity.     Easy liquidity conditions are already prompting banks to modestly transmit past policy rate cuts through their MCLRs and pro-active liquidity management should further facilitate more pass-through, added the note.     The market saw a muted response post the RBI policy statement but the possibility of a rate cut still remains relevant in the next one year, feel experts.     On the domestic front, several factors are helping to support the recovery. After a delayed onset, the south-west monsoon has picked up vigorously from the third week of June.     By early August, the cumulative rainfall was 3 per cent higher than the long period average, with more than 80 per cent of the country receiving normal to excess precipitation.     "We expect CPI inflation to ease to 5.1 per cent by March, which is close to RBI's 5 per cent target, as a good monsoon would douse food inflation from, say, 6 per cent in July. Prices stabilised in July and have already started coming off in August," BofA-ML said.     The investment bank believes 3 per cent above-normal monsoon has led to a 35 per cent jump in sowing of pulses, which should temper the staggering inflation in pulses, which added 60 bps in June CPI print.     We have collated list of twelve rate sensitive stocks from different experts which can deliver up to 40 per cent return if you remain invested in them for minimum time horizon of 6-18 months:     Analyst: Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit BNP Paribas   Ashok Leyland Ltd: BUY| Target Rs 116    Ashok Leyland (AL), the second largest commercial vehicle (CV) manufacturer in India has a strong presence in the M&HCV; segment (accounts for 80% of AL's volume) with a domestic market share of 32.7 per cent and is a direct beneficiary of any improvement in CV cycle.     The segment will continue to perform on the back of revival in the infrastructure projects and improvement in the logistics operator's profitability owing to lower diesel prices.     "We expect AL's revenue to grow at 15 per cent CAGR over FY16-18E along with the implementation of the BS-IV norms by FY17 led by 13 per cent by volume growth and 1.3 per cent by realization growth," said Nair.    Exide Industries Ltd: BUY| Target Price: Rs 204    Exide Industries is the leader in storage battery business with a market share of 60 per cent in India. "We expect automotive demand to strengthen during FY17E through better monsoon and implementation of 7th pay commission and further, the introduction of GST will reduce competition from unorganized players," added Nair.     The technology up gradation (capex Rs4.5bn), rebound in automobile segment, and concentration on the more profitable segment will help to improve margins from 15 per cent in FY16 to 16.3 per cent by FY18E.    Federal Bank Ltd: Accumulate| Target Price: Rs 71    Federal Bank Ltd (FB) is a mid-sized private commercial bank having a network of 1,250 branches across India with a loan book size of about Rs59,000 crore. The major headwind from NPA provisioning has receded, and asset quality would see marginal improvement.     FB has diversified its loan book with high growth retail, SME, and corporate lending. It has grown at a healthy CAGR of 12 per cent over past 5 years and is expected to grow at a healthy CAGR of 16 per cent over FY16-18E. Strong CASA ratio of 33 per cent is a major strength, which is helping to maintain the cost of funds lower.    KEC International Ltd: Hold| Target Price: Rs 157    KEC International Limited (KEC) is a global infrastructure Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) major. Order inflow from SEBs and Power Grid could be the key drivers for growth. KEC is likely to receive an order inflow of Rs9,411cr and Rs11,387cr respectively in FY17E and FY18E, which will drive the order book by CAGR of 9 per cent over FY16-18E.     "We expect the EBITDA margins will improve from current 8.4 per cent to 8.8 per cent in FY18E due to benefit from high margin order book leading to a PAT growth by 27 per cent CAGR over FY16-18E," said Nair.

Bank of Baroda: BUY| Stop Loss Rs128; Target Rs 229    BOB recorded a high of Rs210 (November 2010) then turned bearish and recorded a low of Rs85(August 2013 ). Then turned upward and recorded a high of Rs229 (December 2014).     Further, the stock reacted lower and made a low of Rs109 (February 2016). This indicates that the stock movement since November 2010 has been that of a broader range, forming higher tops and higher bottoms.     The initial downfall from Rs210 to Rs85 was at the 61.8% retracement levels of one larger degree uptrend from Rs26 to Rs210. The stock recent up move from Rs109 appears to be a beginning of uptrend and would lead to a target of Rs229, in a time period of 18 months.    Eicher Motors: BUY| Stop Loss Rs20,500; Target Rs 28,000    Eicher Motors has been under consolidation for past two years. The consolidated range is between Rs13,900 (April 2015 low) and Rs21,620 (July 2015 high). The entire sideways consolidation has formed a "Triangle" pattern.     It made a higher bottom at Rs14,800 (January 2016) and turned positive. Its recent up move form Rs 18,000 gave a good breakout of the "Triangle" pattern as well as the broader consolidated movement. The larger degree trend has once again turned positive. Target is placed at Rs 28,000.    M&M;: BUY| Stop Loss Rs 1,420; Target Rs 1,750    M&M; has been under consolidation between Rs1,442 and Rs1,092 levels, for past 20 months. The price movement within the range was erratic and volatile.     However, its recent up move from Rs1,186 (April 2016 low) till date is quite stable. The up move gave a breakout from the ongoing consolidation.     Following the breakout, the stock has once again moved back into a narrow range. The support base of this consolidation is at Rs 1,431, which was the resistance level of the larger consolidation. Buy for a target of Rs1,750 and a stop loss of Rs 1,420 with a time period of 18 months.
