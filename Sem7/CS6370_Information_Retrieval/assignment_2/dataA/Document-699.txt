  NEW DELHI: India's failure to start development projects on schedule and draw international loans in time has led to the government paying over Rs 600 crore by way of commitment charges in the last six years.     Commitment charges are a fee charged by a lender to a borrower for an unused credit line or undisbursed loan. These charges on undrawn balance of external loans are paid on principal amount rescheduled for drawal on later dates.     A study of the undrawn balance year after year, for which India has been paying additional commitment charges, indicates that the NDA regime's track record in meeting deadlines of projects has been as bad as its predecessor.A comptroller and auditor general (CAG) report, tabled in Parliament last month, shows the undrawn balance of external loans in 2014-15 was Rs 2,10,099 crore.     The penalty paid as commitment charges in 2014-15 was Rs 111 crore. This was Rs 117 crore in 2013-14 and Rs 93 crore the year before that. In the six years between 2009-10 and 2014-15, India has paid over Rs 600 crore as commitment charges making the loans costlier than available in international market.     "The need for payment of commitment charges points towards inadequate planning of the loans credits without proper linkages with the requirement leading to avoidable payment of commitment charges," the CAG says in its report.     India had an external debt of Rs 3.66 lakh crore (as of 31st March 2015), of which Rs 2.37 lakh crore (or 65%) was unutilised committed loans. An earlier study by finance ministry had found that between 1991 and 2009, the government had paid Rs 1,400 crore as commitment charges for unutilised loans.     The sectors that lag behind in matching the pace of the expenditure committed by the government while negotiating the loans include urban development (Rs 33,700 crore), atomic energy (Rs 31,300 crore), roads (Rs 29,500 crore), power (28,500 crore), railways (25,100 crore), water supply & sanitation (Rs 14,900 crore) among others.
