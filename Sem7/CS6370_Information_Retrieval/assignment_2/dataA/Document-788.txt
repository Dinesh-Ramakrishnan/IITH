  MUMBAI: Investment bank Jefferies on Tuesday said that there's limited upside for the Reliance Industries stock, citing high net debt on its balance sheet, which the brokerage said is much higher than in company release and consensus estimates. Shares of RIL, which underperformed so far this year against the benchmark Sensex, declined over a percent on Tuesday to close at Rs 1024.     While downgrading RIL's ratings to 'hold' from 'buy' with a target price of Rs 1,040, Jefferies said that the underlying net debt of the company to be close to $28 billion against $14.3 billion mentioned in its fourth quarter results.     "We added interest bearing-deferred spectrum liabilities of $2.1 billion, capex-related supplier's credit of $7.3 billion, a part of other current liabilities and $3.8 billion increase in trade credit over last year and normalised levels. This implies a $12 billion increase in net debt over FY15 which ties up with $17 billion of capex spend in FY16 less $5 billion of cash flow from operations," the brokerage said.     Jefferies is the first brokerage to downgrade RIL's rating post its June quarter results a month ago. Early this month, Credit Suisse and JP Morgan maintained their 'neutral' rating on the stock while CLSA reiterated its 'buy' rating. Currently, there are about 32 brokerages which have a 'buy' rating on RIL while 10 have a 'hold' rating.     RIL stock gained just 1.13% so far this year as against Sensex return of 7.5%. RIL reported its highest-ever net profit of Rs 27,600 crore for the year ended March 31, 2016, driven by refining and petrochemical business despite low crude oil and energy prices.        Jefferies expects the net debt for Reliance to rise to $32 bn in FY17. The RIL management itself had guided for $9 billion of capex in FY17 at 4QFY16 end.     "This does not include spend on upcoming spectrum auction and spend on increasing coverage of Jio to 90%. Moreover, capex in Q1 alone was $4 billion. These imply an upside risk to the capex guidance. Given estimated cash flow post dividends of $5 billion, debt should rise in FY17, it said.     "Using higher underlying debt on RIL's balance sheet implies little upside for stock price despite factoring in full upside from downstream projects and Jio, which have not increased in line with capex in our view," the brokerage added.     RIL has invested Rs 1.2 lakh crore in its telecom venture as of March '16. The investment has been funded through a mix of equity share capital (Rs 45,000 crore), debt (Rs 33,200 crore) and supplier's credit (Rs 26,000 crore) and deferred payment towards spectrum acquisition (about Rs 13,000 crore).
