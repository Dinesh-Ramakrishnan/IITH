  NEW DELHI: With the Reliance Jio's telecom services undergoing trials, the subsidiary of Reliance Industries (RIL) has been promoting its affordable range of 4G handsets across online portals. But while the RIL stock has picked some momentum of late, it is up just 2 per cent year-to-date against the 8 per cent jump in the BSE Sensex.     If the stock fails to match Sensex's return in 2016, it could be eleventh year when the stock will underperform the 30-pack index in the 15 years to 2016.     Brokerage Jefferies believe that the underlying net debt for RIL to be close to $28 billion against $14.3 billion mentioned in its fourth quarter results, which could cap any material upside for the stock.     "We added interest bearing-deferred spectrum liabilities of $2.1 billion, capex-related supplier's credit of $7.3 billion, a part of other current liabilities and $3.8 billion increase in trade credit over last year and normalised levels. This implies a $12 billion increase in net debt over FY15 which ties up with $17 billion of capex spend in FY16 less $5 billion of cash flow from operations," the brokerage said.     Data compiled by ETMarkets.com showed the RIL stock has underperformed the Sensex in 10 of past 14 calendar years. Last year, the stock outperformed Sensex by rising 12.32 per cent against a 5 per cent fall in the BSE barometer. However, the stock underperformed the index in seven years between 2008 and 2014.     In fact, the RIL stock settled the year 2014 at around the same level, it was around at the end of calendar 2005, BSE data suggested. The stock has tripled to Rs 1,035 level at present from Rs 338 level at the end of 2000. Sensex on the other hand, jumped 7-folds to 28,000 level from nearly 4,000 level in 2000.     Jefferies expects the net debt for Reliance to rise to $32bn in FY17. The RIL management itself had guided for $9 billion of capex in FY17 at 4QFY16 end.     "This does not include spend on upcoming spectrum auction and spend on increasing coverage of Jio to 90 per cent. Moreover capex in Q1 alone was $4 billion. These imply upside risk to the capex guidance. Given estimated cash flow post dividends of $5 billion, debt should rise in FY17, it said.     "Using higher underlying debt on RIL's balance sheet implies little upside for stock price despite factoring in full upside from downstream projects and Jio, which have not increased in line with capex in our view," the brokerage added.
