 BOSTON: With younger generations using cellphones less for actual conversation and more for text messaging, suicide prevention organisations are setting up ways that let distraught youths seek help that way.  Suicide is the second leading cause of death among teenagers and college-age adults, making a text messaging initiative (started this month by Samaritans Inc. of Massachusetts to supplement the more traditional phone help line) a natural, executive director Steve Mongeau said. Nearly 5,300 US residents younger than 24 took their own lives in 2013, the most recent year for which data are available, according to the Washington, DC-based American Association of Suicidology.  "We want you, as a person in need, to be able to use the communication platform you feel most comfortable with," Mongeau said, adding that Samaritans is the first suicide prevention organisation in Massachusetts to offer the texting option.The US department of veterans affairs has offered text help for suicidal veterans for several years. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline also offers text messaging help at many of its more than 160 crisis centres nationwide.  That organisation found that nearly 40% of people reaching out for help using its online chat option indicated they would not feel comfortable seeking help by phone.
