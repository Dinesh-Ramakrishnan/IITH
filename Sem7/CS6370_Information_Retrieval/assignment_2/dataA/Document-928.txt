  MUMBAI: Commercial papers have gained more importance than in the past with the debt market activities picking up with interests from mutual funds and softer rates compared to bank lending rates.     The volume of CP issuance has been steadily increasing over the last few years and stood at an all-time high of Rs 5.29 trillion in Q1 FY2017. Given the shorter tenure of these instruments, the CP outstanding increased by 25% YoY to Rs 3.38 trillion as on June 2016. On the back of a smaller base, the CP outstanding has increased at a CAGR of 35.5% over the last three years as compared to 10.5% for bank credit and 15.0% for corporate bonds; the rating company said.     "The issuer and the investor segment need to be mindful of the potential rollover risks with the reduction in CP tenures in the industry, amidst growing volumes," said Karthik Srinivasan, Senior Vice President and Co Head-Financial Sector Ratings, ICRA Limited. "The main investor class has shifted to the shorter maturity CPs, given the regulation for marked-to-market implications for all investments with residual tenures of more than 60 days."     Better-rated entities are able to raise CPs at around 7% today, which is 150-250 bps lower than the bank lending rates, despite the transition to MCLR system from the current fiscal.     Report of month-end holdings by MFs indicate that the proportion of investments in CPs, with residual maturity of less than 90 days, has increased over the last few quarters to 87% as on June 2016 from 82% as on June 2015 and 79% as on June 2014.     Mutual funds, with a market share of around 65-70%, remain the main investor segment in CPs, followed by banks, which account for 20-25%. The total asset under debt-oriented MFs was around Rs. 9.7 trillion as on July 2016. Mutual funds have been investing around 20-25% of their assets in CPs in the last few quarters.
