  The Tobacco Board has increased the crop size for Andhra Pradesh to 130 million kgs for the fiscal 2016-17 as against 120 million kgs for 2015-16.     The hike was on account of increasing insistence from industry players through the Indian Tobacco Association and farmer groups as the decline in crop area was becoming uneconomical for them.     "The Board after detailed discussions taking into consideration the gloomy situation in the world's market, carryover stocks, declining demand for tobacco in domestic markets, growers' demands for assuring remunerative prices for their produce, decided to fix a crop size of 130 million kgs for Andhra Pradesh during 2016-17 crop season based on the indents received from the Indian Tobacco Association as against 120 million kgs fixed during 2015-16 crop season," said a release from the Tobacco Board after its meeting in Hyderabad on Wednesday.     An official at Tobacco board said, "This will not really be considered an increase as we had reduced the crop size considerably last fiscal to 120 million kgs from 172 million kgs in 2014-15. This was on account of low grade production of tobacco and lack of confirmation from the importers."     Earlier in March, the board had reduced the crop size under tobacco in Karnataka to 95 million kgs from 100 million kgs last year.
