  It is generally believed that expense ratio difference between regular plans and direct plan of debt funds are small and, therefore, retail debt investors will not gain much by going direct. However, many debt funds also exhibit significant gap between expense ratio of regular and direct plan. Though the standard difference in case of debt funds is around 0.58%, in some cases, it can be as high as 1.2%. Around 47 debt funds currently carry an expense ratio of 75 bps or higher. 100 basis points is 1%.     Historical data shows that investors could have saved upto Rs4,900 on a lumpsum investment of Rs1 lakh over the past three years (see table). Since returns from debt funds tend to be much lower than equity funds, this is a significant difference. More importantly, this value will only keep getting bigger with longer time periods.       Since their investment size is big, most of the corporate and high net worth investors have shifted from regular plans to direct plans. With this kind of difference, it makes sense for retail investors also to shift from regular plans to direct plans.     In direct plans, investors can buy schemes directly from asset management companies (AMCs), bypassing distributors. Since there is no upfront brokerage or trail commission to be paid to the distributors, these plans have a lower expense ratio â the yearly fee that investors pay mutual funds â as compared to regular plans bought through a distributor.
