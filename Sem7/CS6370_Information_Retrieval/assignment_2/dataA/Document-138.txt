  MUMBAI: Tata Consultancy Services said it was extending its contract with US airline JetBlue and will expand its innovation centre in Pune to support the airline's digital initiatives.     JetBlue and TCS had an existing three-year to develop new platforms and provide quality assurance and infrastructure services. Under the new agreement, TCS will manage several additional programs, including the modernization of the airline's IT Foundation platform to enhance data analytics and develop tools for customers and JetBlue crewmembers.     TCS will also expand its innovation center in Pune, over the next two years to support critical JetBlue Digital initiatives. TCS already services JetBlue from the US and Mexico.     "This strategic agreement is a reflection of our confidence in TCS as the right partner for our global talent and technology transformational needs," Eash Sundaram, EVP and CIO of JetBlue, said in a statement.     The expanded contract means that JetBlue will also have access to TCS' co-innovation network, specifically the airline and digital labs.     "Organizations need to embrace digital as the default, and we deeply value our relationship with JetBlue as we collectively help to further transform their operations and competitive standing," Surya Kant, President, North America, UK and Europe at TCS, said.
