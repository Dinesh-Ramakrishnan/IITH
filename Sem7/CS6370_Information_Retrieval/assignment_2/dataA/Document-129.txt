  CHANDIGARH: It is no surprise that Haryanvi women, like wrestler and Olympic bronze medallist Sakshi Malik , are made of very tough material. To achieve anything they have to push harder against unsurmountable odds, which in the case of Haryana means the country's worst sex ratio.     According to the 2011 Census, Haryana's sex ratio was the worst in the country â 879 women for every 1,000 men. In fact, Sakshi's village, Mokhra Khas in Rohtak, was worse off with a sex ratio of 822 per 1,000 men. Haryana's child sex ratio was even lower at 834 and a shocking 800 in Mokhra Khas.     But green shoots of hope are starting to emerge. Even as the Sakshis of Haryana wrestle with a patriarchal society and win, attitudes towards women too seem to be changing. The 2016 figures of state health department indicate an improvement with a sex ratio of 884 at birth for Haryana and 931 in Mokhra Khas.     While it may be early to signal a revolution, many more girls have taken to sports in a big way. This is reflected in the fact that the Indian contingent in Rio has more women sportspersons from Haryana than men. Out of 20 Haryanvis in Rio, 12 are women. One reason could be the state government's policy, started a few years ago, of giving a monthly stipend to all boys and girls who meet the minimum requirement in athletic events.     Mokhra Khas's sarpanch Surender Malik believes Sakshi's achievement would lead to further improvement in the status of women and girls in the state. "Earlier, girls were considered a burden thanks to the presence of dowry. But now perceptions have chan- ged. The government's 'Beti bachao, beti padao'+ campaign has also worked," he says.     Sakshi's uncle in the village, Upender Malik, says that her achievement would encourage girls to excel in different fields, not just sports.     Mokhra Khas is one among the four panchayats of Mokhra village, which is 20 km from Rohtak town. Sakshi's family had shifted to Rohtak town about a decade back, but other members of the extended family stayed back in the villages.     Sakshi's grandfather Badlu Ram was a village-level wrestler, but kept his participation limited to local dangals, never taking to professional wrestling. The village 'akhada' has been a centre of attraction for the local youth for decades as wrestling has got them jobs in the police and security forces.     "Despite their struggle at different levels thousands of girls in rural Haryana have started taking part in sports - 60 of them are only in Mokhra Khas," says Surender Malik. "This is sharp contrast to the situation of few decades back when women were even not allowed to go to the village chaupal."     Haryana's director general of health services Kamla Singh says Sakshi's win will certainly discourage those who indulge in female feticide. "The dominance of men in agriculture led to our society becoming more patriarchal but our daughters are doing wonders now," she says.
