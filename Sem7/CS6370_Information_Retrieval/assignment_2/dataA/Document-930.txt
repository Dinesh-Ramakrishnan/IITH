  NEW DELHI: Domestic lenders salvaged the day for the equity market on Thursday, giving a late afternoon liftoff to the benchmark indices after lacklustre trading for most part of the day as investors turned wary of key quarterly corporate results ahead.     The S&P; BSE Sensex and the NSE's Nifty50 opened in the negative and traded flat until about 12 pm. The June wholesale price inflation print, which increased to 1.62 per cent from 0.79 per cent in May, suggested that India Inc is finally getting some respite from declining prices. This along with a strong opening in European markets also lifted investor sentiment.     The Sensex closed the day at 27,942.11, up 0.46 per cent or 126.93 points, while the Nifty50 reclaimed its crucial support level at 8,550 and settled at 8,565, up 45.50 points or 0.53 per cent.           Solid gains on the counters of ICICI Bank (up 2.72 per cent), State Bank of India (up 2 per cent), Axis Bank (up 0.61 per cent) and HDFC Bank (up 0.50 per cent) gave the 30-share benchmark a much-needed relief.     Among non-banking stocks, Maruti Suzuki (up 2.44 per cent), Power Grid Corporation (up 1.82 per cent) and GAIL (up 1.45 per cent) were the top gainers.     Pharma stocks continued to bleed and were among the biggest laggards in the Sensex pack. Sun Pharma (down 1.05 per cent), Cipla (down 0.84 per cent) and Dr Reddy's Laboratories (down 0.84 per cent) ended at the bottom of the pack. Among other losers were ONGC (down 1.53 per cent), Infosys (down 1.45 per cent) and Wipro (down 0.56 per cent).       The BSE Consumer Durables index had a field day, with Symphony (up 3.31 per cent) and Rajesh Exports (up 2.96 per cent) topping the charts.       Among specific stocks, Dwarikesh Sugar jumped 2.81 per cent after credit rating agency ICRA upgraded the rating on the company's long-term loans and other long-term fund-based and non-fund-based facilities totalling Rs 599 crore.        Ahead of the earnings due to be reported post market hours, Tata Consultancy Services added 1.16 per cent. City initiated coverage of NBCC with a buy rating and a target price of Rs 300, which gave the stock a 4.77 per cent lift.      Shares of Carborundum Universal rose 9.11 per cent after Nalanda sold 1.9 crore shares at Rs 230 per share, with Ebam and Enam promoters buying 57 lakh shares in a block deal.        Logistics firm Gati saw a 9.35 per cent spurt after 5.7 per cent equity shares changed hands via a block deal.       Elsewhere in Asia, China's Shanghai Composite ended 0.22 per cent lower while Japan's Nikkei added 0.95 per cent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 1.12 per cent.     At the time of writing of this report, European markets were trading with gains. London's FTSE100 advanced 0.89 per cent, France's CAC40 1.08 per cent and Germany's DAX 1.41 per cent.
