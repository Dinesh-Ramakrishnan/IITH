  NEW DELHI: Microsoft on Wednesday announced the appointment of Crayon Software Experts India Pvt Ltd as a distribution partner under its Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) programme in India.     As part of this programme, Crayon will help its customers in India to adopt Microsoft's Cloud based technology solutions like Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Office 365, Windows Intune and Enterprise Mobility Suite (EMS) subscriptions, a statement said.     "Accelerating cloud adoption amongst SMBs (small and midsize businesses), Crayon's capabilities will offer customers greater technical edge with enterprise-grade technology and fully managed services delivered from the Microsoft cloud," said Manohar Hotchandani, Director-Business Development, Microsoft India.     The partnership means that Crayon will own the complete customer life cycle, combined and customised solutions, while directly provisioning and supporting Microsoft Cloud offerings for their customers.     "The combination of Microsoft's Cloud offerings and Crayon's reach across India, provides customers with enterprise grade Cloud solutions while maintaining the flexibility and scalability to suit their business needs," said Vikas Bhonsle, Chief Executive Officer of Crayon.
