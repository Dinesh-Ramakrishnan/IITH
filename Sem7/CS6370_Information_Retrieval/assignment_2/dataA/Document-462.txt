  NEW DELHI: Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) held in excess of 1 per cent stake in 454 domestic stocks as of June 30, with the top 10 among them holding shares worth over Rs 2 lakh crore.    Europacific growth Fund, which holds over 1 per cent stake in 16 Indian firms, had investment worth Rs 51,564 crore at the end of June quarter, a study by PRIME Database showed. As per the fund's factsheet, it has 7.9 per cent of net assets invested in India. This fund has total asset under management of $ $125,384 million and holds stakes in over 290 companies.    HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, Grasim Industries, Reliance Industries, Reliance Communications and Idea Cellular are some of the stocks where it holds stake.     The Government of Singapore has 19 per cent of its investment in emerging market equities. The fund has investment in 33 domestic firms valued at Rs 41,085 crore. It has investment in companies such as Dr Reddy's Labs, Infosys, HDFC, HDFC Bank, DLF, Lupin and M&M;, among other largecap stocks.     Investment bank Oppenheimer Holdings had about Rs 27,073 crore investment in 14 domestic firms at the end of June quarter. Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund, which manages assets worth $28.6 billion had 14.6 per cent of investments in India.     Started in 1996, this fund has HDFC as its second biggest holding (4.5 per cent of portfolio). It also has Infosys (2.9 per cent) among its top 10 holdings. Another fund, Oppenheimer Emerging Markets Innovators Fund, which invests in midcaps, had Biocon (2.7 per cent) and Shriram Transport (2 per cent) among its top 10 holdings. This fund manages assets worth $242.7 million.     Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) has investment in 21 Indian companies, which as of June 30 was valued at Rs 18,943 crore. This fund generally invests not more than 20 per cent in emerging market equities. In its 2015 review in July, the sovereign wealth fund said, "While the UK, Europe and Australia remain key jurisdictions for many investors and provide reasonable deal flows, there was more meaningful interest and activity in certain Latin American markets besides continued focus on India."     "China is making great strides in integrating its capital markets into global markets, and there are optimistic signs that India is seeking to open its markets to trade and outside investment," it said.     The Government Pension Fund Global had investments in 77 Indian firms worth Rs 14,600 crore. From PI Industries to Ahluwalia Contracts, Allcargo Logistics to Century Plyboards to IIFL Transportation, this fund had investments in 248 firms across sectors by 2015 end. There could be many listed firms, where the fund has less than 1 per cent stake and, hence, they go unnoticed.     It is important to note though that stocks, where an individual FII holding is higher than 1 per cent, represent only 23 per cent of the overall FII stakeholding (Rs 4.57 lakh crore of the Rs 20.13 lakh crore), PRIME Database study said.
