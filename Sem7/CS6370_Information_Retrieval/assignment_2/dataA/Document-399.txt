  While wire-less chargers are yet to gain popularity, a Canadian design company named AR Design wants to make them look cool. The company is running a Kickstarter campaign for its levitating wireless charger that will recharge your smartphone while making it float on air. The gadget called OvRcharge, has been backed by a round 186 people and has already reached its goal of $40,000 (Canadian) on Kickstarter.     "By combining induction charging and magnetic levitation we got OvRcharge. This wireless levitational charger not only suspends the device in mid air and holds its altitude, but also charges and rotates it," says the company.     OvRcharge is basically a wooden box with the magnetic levitation and wireless charging technology inside. Interestingly, the gadget will also work with smartphones that do not support wireless charging. Buyers will only need to get a wireless charging case along with the levitation magnet.     "The charging base is the thing behind all the science, it is made of wood and has two functions â magnetic levitation and wireless charging. This unit is powerful enough to levitate 600 grams unit and charge it," the company says.     While the smartphone is floating in air, users can make it spin and as there is no friction to stop it, the smartphone keeps spinning as long as it is floating. "OvRcharge stops charging the phone when the battery is full but still levitates and rotates the device until it is removed. You c a n us e it t o charge your phone or just to float it," says the company.
