  The Guinness Book of Records was first published on August 27, 1955. Excluding non-copyright works such as the Bible and the Quran, GWR is the world's all-time best-selling tome, with global sales in some 37 languages exceeding hundred million.Here are a few facts about the reference book.     -Finishing the first 198-page volume edition took 13 and a half 90-hour weeks. Guinness' original plan was to hand out free copies to around 80,000 Irish & British pubs. But word-of-mouth public demand transformed the book into a runaway bestseller.     -1 million editions were sold by 1964.        -Ashrita Furman is a GWR record-breaker. He currently holds nearly 200 records, including the record for holding the most Guinness world records. His other records include highest mountain peak climbed on stilts, tallest object balanced on chin, fastest kiwi-peeler, highest number of jumping jacks.     -Annually, around 50,000 people apply to Guinness World Records in the hope their achievement will make it into print. Only around 1,000 actually do make the cut.        -Caitlyn Jenner's Vanity Fair cover shoot in 2015 helped her take the title for the fastest ever time to reach one million followers on Twitter, with her new account hitting the 1 million mark in an incredible 4 hours and 3 minutes. The record was previously held by US President Barack Obama who racked up a million followers in 4 hours 52 minutes.     -Although the name Guinness remains, it is not owned by the brewery anymore. GWR changed a number of hands â owned by Guinness PLC and subsequently Diageo, it was sold off to Gullane Entertainment, owners of Thomas the Tank Engine in 2001.     It was sold to HIT Entertainment, owners of Bob the Builder in 2002. As of 2008, GWR is owned by Jim Pattison Group, the parent company of Ripley Entertainment.
