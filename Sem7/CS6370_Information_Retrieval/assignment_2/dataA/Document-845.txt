How risky is it?    Should you buy?   This balanced fund has a stellar long term track record, but has seen perfomance falter in recent years. In the hands of a highly experienced and capable fund manager, the fund takes a more aggressive approach compared to peers. The risk component in this fund is very highâstandard deviation much higher on a relative basis.     In the equity portion, the fund manager has placed heavy bets on banking stocks and has also invested in companies with lower market cap compared to peers. He is equally aggressive in the debt component of the fund, with high allocation to longer maturity government paper which is highly sensitive to interest rate changes. Given the elevated risk profile, the fund may not suit conservative investors.    All data as on 31 May 2016, unless specified.    Source: Value Research
