  If Nifty manages to break out above the crucial level of 8710 then there may be a sharp up-move towards 8800-8900 in short term. The index is expected to trade in a broader range of 8500-8900 over the coming weeks with a bullish bias. When Nifty reaches near-term targets of 8780-8830 traders should start lightening up their longs and focus on individual stocks with a proper exit strategy, as there may be a pause in the bullish momentum.    CHANDAN TAPARIA  DERIVATIVES & TECHNICAL ANALYST, ANAND RATHI     The Nifty has been making higher top-higher bottom on weekly chart and rallied around 27% in last five months. Recently it started its move after the consolidation of last 19 trading sessions and also registered a record 52-weeks high close. We have seen sustained buying interest in the market as every small decline is being bought even after being in the over-bought trading trajectory.    Market base is inching higher  as previous hurdles are now converting in to support zones. Till it remains above 8475-8500, trend may remain intact. If it fails to hold 8475 zones then only the bulls need to be worried for their leveraged long positions.    The Bank Nifty  has been flirting with psychological barrier of 19,000 mark for last couple of days and needs to hold the same with follow up buying to start the next leg of the rally. In auto pack Tata Motors, Maruti, Motherson Sumi and Bharat Forge look strong; while in banking, HDFC Bank, Yes and IndusInd are likely to hold their commands. Housing fi nance companies like LIC Housing may witness support-based buying while DHFL may extend its upmove. Metals counters like JSW Steel, Hindalco and Tata Steel are also witnessing positive price action on small decline.    SAMEET CHAVAN   TECHNICAL ANALYST - EQUITY, ANGEL BROKING    Where Are We?  The weekly change in the Nifty does not actually depict the volatility that the index was subject to during the week. The concluded week saw the Nifty witness a minor corrective move after breaching the 'Rising Wedge' pattern. The index then rebounded sharply after nearing the strong support zone of 8500-8480.    What is in Store?  From a technical analysis perspective, we now expect the index to slip into a consolidation mode and this would make it diffi cult to fi nd clear trades. From a larger degree view, the trend remains bullish and we reiterate at the likelihood of the Nifty reaching the next resistance zone of 8780 - 8830 quite soon. In the forthcoming week, the Nifty would gain momentum after surpassing 8711.30 convincingly; whereas, on the fl ipside, 8590 - 8518 would now be seen as important support levels.    What Can Investors Do?  Going forward, in case of the Nifty reaching our near-term targets of 8780 - 8830 (the 'Super Trend' indicator on Monthly chart is placed at 8830), then we would advise traders to start lightening up their longs as we may then see some pause in the bullish momentum. Traders are further advised to shift their focus on individual stocks following a proper exit strategy.    RAJESH PALVIYA   HEAD - TECHNICAL & DERIVATIVES ANALYST, AXIS SECURITIES    Where Are We?  On the weekly chart, Nifty manages to hold its bullish gap area 8407-8398 for the fourth consecutive week indicating fi rm support zone around 8400 levels. Also, for second consecutive week it managed to hold its weekly 5 EMA (8530) which remains a crucial shortterm support. The index is currently sustaining above its important moving averages (20 DMA (8570), 50 DMA (8354) and 100 DMA (8050)) which indicate market is bullish for short /medium term. The daily and weekly strength indicator RSI is moving upwards and above its reference line indicating positive bias. Overall bullishness to persist.    What is in Store?  Over last 2-3 weeks the Nifty has been consolidating in the range of 8710-8500 representing short-term consolidation. If it manages to break out above the crucial level of 8710, then we may see a sharp upmove towards 8800-8900 in the short term. The index is expected to trade in a broader range of 8500-8900 over the coming weeks with a bullish bias.    What Can Investors Do?  Nifty's higher high-low formation on monthly and weekly charts indicates that the index is gaining strength. Chart pattern suggests 8800 and 8900 are very important resistance levels, hence some profi t booking action may take place near this resistance area. We advise to buy stocks if the Nifty corrects in near/short term to 8500-8400, which is a strong support zone.
