  BENGALURU: American big data and analytics firm Zeta Interactive plans to spend $10-50 million as it scouts for acquisitions in India.     The Blackstone-backed company, which is valued at $1 billion, plans to buy out an Indian firm that will help it get on board local clients in sectors such as financial services, ecommerce, travel and automobiles. "During my eight-day visit to India, I had several meetings with big data analytic startups and we might close the deal with one very interesting player but will continue to scout for more before we finalise the investment," said David A Steinberg, founder of Zeta Interactive.     It is looking to acquire a firm having both quality sales force and strong software infrastructure that can be integrated into its system while focussing on selling its products in the Indian market.     Zeta Interactive has hired nearly 500 people in India and plans to double it in the next two years.     The company has about 840 clients and after its buying of Acxiom's email services unit Acxiom Impact for over $50 million, the number has grown to 900 clients.
