  NEW YORK: In an effort to make people switch to Microsoft Edge, the company will now pay you to use the browser, which the company claims can last longer than its Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Opera counterparts.     Edge can deliver 36-53 per cent more battery life while doing daily tasks, including watching videos on YouTube, browsing internet or checking in with friends on social networks.    Microsoft Rewards, announced earlier this week, is a rebranding of Bing Rewards and so far only available in the US, offers points for using Edge and Bing, as well as shopping at the Microsoft store, CNET.com reported on Friday.     You have to make Bing, a web search engine owned and operated by Microsoft, as your default search engine to earn points in its revamped rewards programme.     Points can be traded in for vouchers or credits to places like Amazon, Starbucks, Skype and the ad-free version of Outlook.com.     "Almost three-quarters of Windows 10 users are not using the Edge browser," the report noted.     Microsoft once dominated the browser game with Internet Explorer, a predecessor to Edge.     Over the last decade, however, Edge has seen a significant decline in usage as alternatives such as Google's Chrome and Mozilla's Firefox have gained popularity and Internet Explorer failed to keep up.
