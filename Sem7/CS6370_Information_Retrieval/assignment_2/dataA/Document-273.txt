  Instead of resolving an issue, a breakdown in communication only adds to the problem. If you don't nip it in the bud, lack of communication could yield bad consequences. While offering the silent treatment at home could see you sleeping on the couch indefinitely, not communicating with a team member can impact the whole company and your performance. Here's how to fill the gap.    Mr Cool   Someone has to be the bigger person in this situation, so it might as well be you. Maintaining your composure is crucial in this situation so that things don't get out of hand. Make sure that you use your levelheaded judgment to keep the situation productive. If you too let your emotions reign supreme, it's only going to make the communication gap bigger and nastier.    Speak clearly   You are going to have to speak up eventually, but make sure your thoughts are clear and well-framed. Be direct in your approach. It's better to start off with facts rather than leading the conversation into emotional waters. If verbal communication seems difficult, consider writing an email, so that you can state your points clearly. However, this comes with its own pitfalls as a simple statement could be misconstrued over an email. So choose your words carefully.    Fix it   Accept that there is an issue and point out the things that have gone wrong. Hopefully putting the problems at the fore will knock some sense into your silent-treatment buddy. However, do watch your tone â you don't want to come across as if you are accusing them for all your woes. If it is work-related, hold a meeting where better communication tips are presented to one and all. At home, a small token of appreciation or affection could help soften the blow.    Or else...   We aren't the biggest fans of ultimatums but sometimes it is necessary. During a meeting about effective communication, it's easy for people to say how they are going to change. But sometimes, it doesn't work. While nothing is going to change overnight, make it clear to your team or colleague that if it continues down the same useless path, you will have to take this problem up with your boss. At home, while you cannot issue an ultimatum, offer a time frame to observe change or suggest consulting a counsellor.    Your expectations   Do not hope for a miracle, especially at the workplace. The gap often takes months to dissolve. Accept the small things that your co-worker is doing to ease the situation but don't expect to become best buds overnight. Bridging the gap is a work in progress, so be patient and look at the positives on a daily basis.
