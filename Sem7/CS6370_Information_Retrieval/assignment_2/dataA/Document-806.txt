 NEW DELHI: Optimism over prevailing global liquidity helped the benchmark equity indices reclaim important levels on Friday amid hopes that the market will manage to attract heavy flows over the short to medium term on the back of the recent reforms overdrive, including the just-passed GST bill.     The Sensex recaptured the 28,000 mark to settle the day at 28,078.35, up 363.98 points, or 1.31 per cent. Twenty-three of the 30 index stocks ended higher. The Nifty50 added 132.05 points, or 1.54 per cent, to end at 8,683.15. BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices advanced 1.69 per cent and 1.47 per cent,respectively.     Two-wheeler makers Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto remained the top Sensex gainers for the day. Hero MotoCorp soared 5.02 per cent to Rs 3,434.30, while Bajaj Auto ended the day 4.38 per cent higher at Rs 2,859.85. The two stocks gained on healthy July sales numbers.    Shares of Axis Bank climbed 3.62 per cent to Rs 565.45. Tata Motors, SBI, M&M; and L&T; jumped 3.21 per cent, 3.21 per cent, 3.16 per cent and 2.88 per cent, respectively. There were hopes that RBI may cut interest rates next week at its August 9 policy review after the government, as was prerequisite, carried out reforms in the monsoon session of Parliament.     Top losers included Sun Pharma, which fell 0.79 per cent to Rs 842.35. Among others, Power Grid, Wipro, Bharti Airtel and Infosys declined 0.67 per cent, 0.65 per cent, 0.56 per cent and 0.44 per cent, respectively.     Global cues were positive after the Bank of England (BoE) on Thursday cut policy rates to 0.25 per cent from 0.5 per cent for the first time in seven years and announced a big stimulus package to support growth in the economy, which has chosen to split from the European Union.     The Rajya Sabha earlier this week passed the (122nd) Constitution amendment bill unanimously, paving the way for the introduction of GST in India. The reform drive, along with earnings revival, a good monsoon and the pay commission award, have made domestic fundamentals look strong, even as some experts remained concerned over valuations, which are slightly higher than long-term averages.     "Everybody knows that everything is very richly valued, everything looks pretty much overvalued, when you look at the Nifty's trailing numbers. But despite the fact that valuations are so expensive, this rally is likely to continue in the short term. I would not be surprised if the rally takes us to 9,000-9,200 levels," said Rajat Sharma, CEO, Sana Securities.     Shares of Bharat Forge rallied 12.51 per cent to Rs 814.75 after Chairman and Managing Director BN Kalyani said he believes the phase of sequential sales decline had passed.    Suzlon Energy advanced 5.21 per cent to Rs 17.15 after Chairman Tulsi Tanti said the company would exit the corporate debt restructuring (CDR) programme offered by its lenders before March 2017. Shares of Vedanta gained 4.48 per cent to Rs 169.05 after the company said the import and transit permits for the company's iron ore business at Goa had been re-issued on August 3.    GlaxoSmithkline Consumer Healthcare dropped 2.74 per cent to Rs 6,180.80 after net profit rose 2.92 per cent to Rs 160.61 crore for the June quarter.
