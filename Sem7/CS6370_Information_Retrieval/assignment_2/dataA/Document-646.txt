 In this interview with ET Now, SN Subrahmanyan of L&T; talks about the contract to convert Nagpur into and intergrated 'Smart City'. Edited excerpts:   L&T; has got a contract to convert Nagpur into an integrated 'Smart City'. Can you highlight the nature of the order and the contract size?   Yes, this is a continuation of our Smart World Communication business. It is an interesting proposition where we are converting cities march towards Prime Minister's and Chief Minister's intentives. We are doing this for Mumbai City. We have placed cameras and various other instruments at strategic locations, created command control centres, mobile vans etc. by which the entire city can be tracked.     Now we are putting up the same proposition at Nagpur and this includes fibre optic cable network, putting Wi-Fi hotspots, interactive kiosks and inclusion cameras at various locations across the city. Over a period of time, we will be able to cover the entire city through this process. The governance in the city will become absolutely different, the police force and the intelligent forces can sit in a particular command control centre and look into various aspects of the city, traffic violations, governance issues, parking matters, the crowd management.    What is the size of the contract and execution time?   The contract is Rs 550 crore odd in phase one and and we hope to add on to it. We would be creating the platform and therefore to add on would be interesting from the authorities point of view.
