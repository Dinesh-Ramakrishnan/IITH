  Increasing volatility in markets should be a signal for investors to look for consistent performers in mutual funds. Among diversified equity funds, in the past eight years, Mirae Asset India Opportunities has been one of the consistent performers.     The scheme's fund manager Neelesh Surana has been consistent with the fund house's philosophy of selecting high growth businesses at reasonable prices. The focus has been on the companies which have generated high return on capital employed (RoCE) and are expected to enhance it further. These two key factors have played a critical role in the scheme's outperformance as opposed to its benchmark S&P; BSE 200 and its peers.        The scheme invests 70-80% of its portfolio in large-sized companies and the remaining part is invested in mid-sized companies. With the help of these factors, in the past seven, five and three years, the scheme has given 18%, 17.8% and 27.6% returns, respectively, while its benchmark S&P; BSE 200 in the same period has returned 9.6%, 11.4%, and 18.1%, respectively.     In the same period, the scheme's category has given 13.3%, 14.6% and 24.5% returns, respectively. At present, the scheme is invested in large-sized companies which are fundamentally sound but have been beaten down in the recent volatility. These companies are Tata Motors, Lupin, Housing Development Finance Corporation, Larsen & Toubro, Crompton Greaves and State Bank Of India. Also going by the recent encouraging railway freight traffic data, the scheme's fund manager has bought into Container Corporation of India.
