  NEW DE LHI: Domestic air passenger growth was a healthy 25.8% in July, when IndiGo strengthened its top position with a 39.8% share of the market. A total of 85.08 lakh people flew last month compared with 67.62 lakh a year earlier.     IndiGo was follow    ed by Jet Airways and Jet Lite, which together carried 19.1% of the passengers, according to data compiled by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation.     IndiGo offered the highest number of seats in the domestic sector with a fleet of 110 Airbus 320 aircraft. The airline, in its first-quarter results for this financial year, had said that it added 25% capacity over the year-ago period. Airlines in India offer 240,000 domestic seats daily and IndiGo's share was about 38%.     IndiGo President Aditya Ghosh had said during a conference call after the results that the airline will offer cheaper fares to match completion.     "We did not match some of these competitive fares by our competitors but we might relook at that going ahead," Ghosh had said.    SpiceJet had the highest passenger load factor at 92% during the month, followed by GoAir, which flew with over 90% of its flights full. SpiceJet also recorded the secondbest on-time performance in July at 79.2%. Vistara topped the list by flying 80.3% of its flights on time. Indi-Go was third with 76.8% of its flights on time.
