  NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market seemed to have shrugged off the scare over Mauritius tax treaty recast and turned upbeat all through Thursday, giving the Sensex a 193-point lift.     That, even when investors remained cautious ahead of key economic data, scheduled for release later in the day. Nonetheless, considering how the market was spooked on Wednesday, the equity benchmarks definitely put up a brave show.     For a detailed account of every small or big move in the market through the day, click here     The S&P; BSE Sensex opened 100 points higher in morning trade and gained steadily all through the day. At around 1 pm, the momentum was lost some bit but that was shortlived and the market quickly regained the tempo.     The 30-share Sensex closed at 25,790.22, up 193.20 points or 0.75 per cent while the broader Nifty50 ended at 7,900.40, with a gain of 51.55 points or 0.66 per cent.     Government data on the index of industrial production for March and consumer price index for April will be released later on Thursday.     Twenty one out of 30 Sensex stocks ended with gains.

The BSE IT index emerged as the top sectoral performer with 1.12 per cent gains, thanks to Aptech and Tata Elxsi.

The BSE Bankex closed 0.95 per cent higher. "I expect the Bank Nifty to progress towards 17,000 and that is a trigger I would await. The breakout in the Nifty is what everybody is waiting for. That will definitely bring in more clarity," said Dr CK Narayan, Founder, Chart Advise.     Shares of RSWM gained 13.56 per cent after the company reported a 7 per cent YoY rise in net profit for the March quarter.     Sutlej Textiles gained 12.25 per cent. The company reported a 78 per cent year-on-year jump in March quarter net profit at Rs 49 crore.

Shares of Dr Reddy's ended 3.65 per cent higher despite having reported an 85.62 per cent year-on-year fall in consolidated net profit for March quarter at Rs 74.60 crore.

Market through the day:  The S&P; BSE Sensex rallied over 200 points in morning trade on Thursday led by gains in ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, L&T;, SBI, and Asian Paints.     The Nifty50 reclaimed its crucial psychological level of 7,900 supported by gains in consumer durable, capital goods, banks, auto, realty, and metal stocks.     "The minor blip that you are seeing -- probably shows consolidation of 200 points on the Nifty50 - shows no real breakout either way. We already had two months of very strong upward trend and the market is not giving away that significantly, which is a good sign. From a short-term perspective, this consolidation should probably be taken positively. I am looking at a breakout of the 8,000 level soon and a May F&O; expiry above that level," said Kunal Bothra, Head Advisory, LKP.     The broader market traded in line with the benchmark indices with the BSE midcap and smallcap indices rising 0.51 and 0.49 per cent, respectively.     The rupee fell 7 paise to 66.63 against the US dollar in early trade on Thursday despite a strong show by most Asian currencies after the US dollar index June future on ICE overnight recorded its first decline in seven sessions.     The domestic currency had closed 11 paise higher at 66.56 in the previous session amid fag-end dollar selling by banks and exporters.

HUL (down 0.6 per cent), HDFC Bank (down 0.27 per cent), Dr Reddy's Laboratories (down 0.15 per cent) and CIL (down 0.02 per cent) were the major Sensex losers.      Five things you must know about today's market:    Technical charts suggest rangebound trading:  Experts believe Nifty50 should trade in a broad range in the coming days. "I still believe the broader range of 7,700-7,980-8,000 remains and within that we got a 90-point range i.e. 7,880-7,890 on the upside and the 7,810-7,800 range on the downside, where two or three important technical pivots are placed on the short-term half-hourly charts. For the time being, wait for that breakout to happen and remain stock-specific. If we get past the 7,890 level, we should head towards the upper end of the range. If we fall below the 7,800-7,810 range, then we should possibly head to retest the 7,700 level," said Mitesh Thacker of miteshthacker.com.    Asian markets stay negative:  Most Asian markets were trading lower this morning. Japan's benchmark Nikkei traded 0.53 per cent lower at 16,486.26. Other Asian indices, including South Korea's Kospi (down 0.15 per cent), China's Shanghai Composite (down 1.06 per cent) and Taiwan's TWSE (down 0.05 per cent), traded lower.     Earnings to generate stock-specific actions: Stock-specific action is likely on the counters of companies that are scheduled to disclose their quarterly numbers during the day.     On Thursday, Dr Reddy's Labs, Glenmark, Arvind, Manappuram Finance, Nestle India, MPRL, Polaris Consulting, Zydus Wellness and Vijaya Bank will disclose their quarterly numbers.     As many as 257 companies will report their March quarter earnings through the week. "The earnings have been fairly in line with expectations. We have a top line growth of something like 6 per cent for the broad market and have seen 8-9 per cent growth in net profit. We have also seen margin expansion by about 100 basis points. I think this quarter has not been too bad," said Sashi Krishnan, Chief Investment Officer, Birla Sun Life Insurance.    US market ended lower on Wednesday:  The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 217.23 points, or 1.21 per cent, in overnight trade to close at 17,711.12.
