  About 70 million people live in diabetes in India and The World Health Organization estimates that an additional 36 million remain ignorant of their condition. This means that nearly 1 in 10 Indians suffers from this condition but is either unaware of it or is slipping through the treatment cracks with inadequate reporting and monitoring. With a desire to bridge those gaps in chronic disease management, especially diabetes with intelligent use of technology, Diabetacare was launched in the 2013.  Medha Gupta  talks to the managing director and founder of Diabetacare Sanjiv Aggarwal about his venture and further expansion plans.    When did you start Diabetacare and why did you plan to enter into such a niche sector?    I started Diabetacare in 2013 with the desire to bring about a paradigm shift in diabetes management system in India by moving it from a deeply fragmented model to a 360-degree comprehensive care one. Having worked in the healthcare industry for over two decades -- both in India and with National Health Service in the United Kingdom - I could see the gaps clearly and realised that intelligent use of technology can make a huge difference towards bridging those gaps in chronic disease management, especially diabetes.     As a doctor and an entrepreneur, this unique situation presented both the responsibility and an opportunity to contribute. Diabetacare is a marriage of the advance treatment strategy and technological innovation for the management of diabetes, with the intent of delaying complications and preventing premature mortality.    What was the seed capital you had to put into your startup? What is your revenue model at present?    I started with a modest sum of Â£1m and we have multiplied it with further strategic investments. Our revenue model at present is a complex mix of connected and customised patient services as well as technology partnerships.    Who are your competitors and how do you stand out?    Our model and 24x7 connected patient offering is unique in India. In India, we are a first-to- market, patient- and physician-focused model. Our unique solution - people, processes and technology - makes Diabetacare a trusted partner of clinicians and a one-stop shop for diabetes-related diagnostics, treatment, and education for patients.    How has the growth trajectory been?    It has been been good so far. We started three years ago with a single experience center in Koramangala, Bengaluru, and a few partner physicians. Today, we have five experience centers in the country - Bengaluru, New Delhi, Hyderabad, Kochi and Chennai - and 100+ partner physician sites. Our Bengaluru experience center was the first standalone diabetes center in India to be accredited by NABH (National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare), the apex body in India for quality accreditation. We have treated 30950 unique patients to date. And that number grows as we speak.    Of all the places, why did you choose to begin from Koramangala?    Diabetacare is a clinico-technology solution provider. Bengaluru is a technology and startup hub. For us, it was an ideal place to both develop a solution and market it to a receptive audience that believes in the convergence of IT and healthcare.    Does it help being based out in a start-up ecosystem like Koramangala?    Certainly. We believe Koramangala, like many neighbourhoods in Bengaluru, provides an ecosystem that supports new ideas and is willing to test these out with enthusiasm, a will to learn and the capacity to adapt.     The most positive trend we've witnessed with the opening of new experience centers across India is that the country - and not just its select established start-up hubs - is operating in a startup mode and becoming extremely entrepreneurial and innovative.    What are the new technologies being used by Diabetacare?    With a focus on 24x7 monitoring and 360-degree care, Diabetacare employs technology that couples a diabetes electronic medical record system with clinical decision-making algorithms. Our DxNETâ¢ has been devised per the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines.     A vital part of our solution offering are the smart M2M-connected glucometers and blood pressure- machines. We educate and enable patients to use these machines; readings are automatically recorded on the device, communicated to the patient's doctor's mobile device and relayed to us at the experience center. This process enables all relevant parties to monitor patient's progress and offer interventions, when and where necessary.    What are the services you are offering to your clients to maintain your customer base?    Our services include: 24x7 support to patients and partner physicians for effortless monitoring and quick interventions A 24x7 tele-contact center which closely monitors patient data and offers regular clinical and non-clinical advice (to patients and their caregivers) for improved adherence, adoption, and maintenance of diabetes DiabetaCart, a mobile diagnostic tool, to screen patients (comprehensive lab tests) at remote locations or partner physician sites for diabetes-related complications (eye, heart, kidney and foot).    What are your future plans for the venture?    In the near term, we will take Diabetacare to different markets within India, increasing our footprint from metros to tier 2 and tier 3 cities. What we offer is an attractive solution for diabetes patients and clinicians. At the price we offer these solutions, this is affordable connected healthcare.     In partnership with Vodafone, Diabetacare recently emerged as one of the three finalists in the Internet of Things category at the 2016 Global Mobile (GLOMO) Awards. Ever since, we have received many queries from interested partners from all over the world and some of these may translate into our medium term growth strategy.     In the long term, we hope to help change the way people approach diabetes management in India (and abroad) and with the right level of awareness, perhaps also help prevent the steady rise of diabetes through regular screenings and lifestyle interventions.    How important is it to raise awareness among people about diabetes? How do you think the scenario has changed in the last 10 years?    It is extremely important to raise awareness. The medical community today is focusing more and more on prevention â not just for diabetes, but all communicable and non-communicable diseases. Much like vaccines helped humanity fight or eradicate a number of deadly diseases, preventive lifestyles are now being touted as the first and preferred line of defense against modern lifestyle-induced conditions such as diabetes.     Much has changed in the last 10 years. We are faced with scenarios where patients with no family history of a disease develop it; and in some cases they do have a family history but prefer not to confront it. Clinicians encounter another set of people who are aware they have diabetes but are unaware that it is a risk factor for so many other lifestyle diseases and fatal conditions.     Indians, as an ethnic group, are at high risk for developing insulin resistance. Furthermore, diabetes onset in India is about a decade earlier than that in the West, so we have a larger number of young people developing the condition. The growing incidence of type 2 diabetes in children is alarming. Obesity, caused by inactivity and a poor diet, is a real threat and unless we actively educate people, we may end up with a huge disease burden for the country and an unhealthy workforce.     Besides education, smart devices help people keep a regular check on calorie consumption, physical activity levels, blood pressure and BMI. This will push people towards healthier lifestyles and change mindsets. We must be proactive and connected when it comes to monitoring our health or treating a condition. There is no other effective path to wellness.
