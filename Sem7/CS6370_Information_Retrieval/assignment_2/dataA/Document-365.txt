This fund has been a decent performer through the years, without really standing out in its category. It manages to beat its benchmark consistently, but at times struggles to keep up with many of its peers. It tilts towards bluechips and largecaps compared to peers. While its top picks are benchmark heavyweights, the fund does not mirror the index and its portfolio is reasonably diversified.     While the fund tends to perform better than many peers during a market uptick, it has not been able to cushion the downside as well. Conservative investors may opt for this fund, but those seeking higher returns should go for more aggressive and proven options in this segment.
