  KOLKATA: Cennergi (Pty) Ltd, Tata Power's 50:50 joint venture with Exxaro Resources in South Africa, announced commercial operations for its 95 megawatt Tsitsikamma community wind farm project.     The wind farm consists of 31 Vestas make turbines each with a generation capacity of 3.075 MW. Cennergi was selected as the preferred bidder for two wind projects under the second window of the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme by the South African government.     With commissioning of the Tsitsikamma project, Cennergi's operational portfolio has increased to 229 megawatt as it had achieved commercial operations of its 134 MW Amakhala Emoyeni Wind project recently last month on 28th July 2016.     Anil Sardana, managing director at Tata Power, said, "Tata Power has been pursuing growth opportunities in India and overseas. Our successful partnership with Exxaro represented a significant move towards augmenting our global footprint and resulting in Cennergi becoming a preferred bidder for two wind projects.     The commissioning of the Tsitsikamma Community Wind farm has further augmented Tata Power's renewables portfolio outside India and represents the company's commitment and progress on its objectives of enhancing non-fossil based generation portfolio up to 30-40% of its total generating capacity and thereby creating value for its stakeholders".
