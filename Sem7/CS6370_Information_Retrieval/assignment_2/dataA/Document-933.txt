  NEW DELHI: The S&P; BSE Sensex slipped over 100 points on Wednesday with weakness in other Asian markets and European markets ahead of the Brexit vote on Thursday taking its toll on sentiments.     The Nifty50 was trading around its crucial level of 8,200 supported by gains in realty, power, oil & gas, capital goods, and pharma stocks.     "If Britain leaves the European Union, the volatility that we have seen over the past few trading sessions would intensify and it perhaps can have some impact on emerging markets (EMs) as well. This is a very big event that we need to watch out for," said Aditi Nayar, Senior Economist, ICRA.     The broader market outperformed the benchmark indices with the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices gaining 0.16 and 0.25 per cent, respectively.    Market @ 9:20    The 30-share index was trading at 26838, up 25 points or 0.09 per cent. It touched a high of 26,839.80 and a low of 26,772.94 in morning trade.     The Nifty50 was trading at 8223.75 up 4 points or 0.05 per cent. It touched a high of 8,225.85 and a low of 8,208.15 in the first 30 minutes of trade.     The S&P; BSE Midcap Index was up 0.28 per cent and BSE S&P; Smallcap Index was trading 0.35 per cent higher.     Dr Redyy's Laboratories (up 0.9 per cent), ONGC (up 0.53 per cent), M&M; (up 0.52 per cent) and Adani Ports (up 0.50 per cent) were the major Sensex gainers.     HUL (down 0.7 per cent), Tata Motors (down 0.6 per cent), RIL (down 0.25 per cent), HDFC (down 0.23 per cent), and ITC (down 0.21 per cent) were the major index losers.   Five things you must know about today's market:   Is correction on the cards?  Analysts believe if the recent trend of foreign outflows continues, we may see weakness in domestic equities.     "We did not fall when global markets were falling. We held up value well. But in the past two days, FII flows remained negative. If this trend continues, that may bring the market down. If there is any hiccup on GST, the market would start reacting. A good monsoon is already baked in. A lot the positives have already got discounted in the prices," market expert Ajay Bagga said.     Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Research at Centrum Wealth, said the Nifty was likely to find support in the 8,155-8,180 range in the short term. "The overall structure indicates buy on declines and a bullish structure as long as a closing beyond 8,000 is maintained," Khemka said.    Brexit still a possibility, suggests poll:  Brexit is still a possibility after a poll showed the percentage of voters supporting Britain's exit from the EU had risen to 44 per cent from 42 per cent in a previous poll conducted on Sunday. A plurality of respondents still preferred 'Remain' but just a one-point margin, with 45 per cent supporting it, Reuters said.    ECB, US Fed cautious:  US Fed Chair Janet Yellen in an overnight testimony to the US Congress said, "I don't think that (Brexit) is the most likely case, but we just don't really know what will happen and we will have to watch it very carefully."    European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, on the other hand, said told European Parliament that Britain's referendum on Thursday was adding uncertainty to markets, and that the ECB was ready to act with all instruments, if necessary. Draghi said further monetary policy stimulus was in the pipeline.    Asian markets stay mixed:  Asian markets were trading mixed this morning. Japan's benchmark Nikkei was trading 1.01 per cent lower at 16,006. China's Shanghai Composite rose 0.14 per cent to 2,882. Other Asian indices, including South Korea's Kospi (up 0.22 per cent) and Taiwan's TWSE (up 0.19 per cent), traded sideways.    US market surged on Tuesday:  The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 23.9 points, or 0.13 per cent, in overnight trade to close at 17,828.77. The S&P; 500 rose 5.63 points, or 0.27 per cent, to 2,088.88. The Nasdaq Composite added 6.55 points, or 0.14 per cent, to close at 4,843.76. "Forward price-to-earnings ratios for equities have increased to a level well above their median of the past three decades," the Fed's biannual monetary policy report said.
