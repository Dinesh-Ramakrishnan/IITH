 I am a retired person and have an amount of Rs 40 lakh to be invested. I get a monthly income of Rs.6000/- from pension. We are a family of 4 adults and our monthly expenses are around 30000/- to 35000/-. Can you suggest some saving schemes through which I could keep my capital intact and also meet my monthly expenses? ---Sarbinder Singh   You can invest in a 5-year bank fixed deposit of Rs15 lakh @ 7.75% , Rs15 lakh in 8.6% Senior Citizen Scheme with a quarterly payout option, and Rs 10 lakh into AAA-rated corporate deposit earning 8.25% monthly payout option. So your total tax-free income in hands will be Rs 27900 per month from investments and Rs 6000 from pension, totalling Rs 33900 per month. As per your tax slab you would be taxed @10% in order to earn a tax-free income. Hence you would need to invest Rs 1 lakh each year u/s 80C. This would be from the above fixed deposits divided into tenures of 1/2/3/4/5 years respectively. As they mature you can invest into 5-year bank fixed deposit for Sec 80C benefit. Please note 87A of Rs 2000 rebate has been considered in the calculation.    I am an engineering aspirant of class 12 from Kota, Rajasthan, and I wish to be financially self independent. Is there any way in which I can generate an income of 5000-6000 per month via stocks/equities/mutual funds for my expenses? -- Anant Kasodekar   We think stocks/ equities / mutual funds require a higher risk appetite and they are designed to provide growth more than income, also you need to invest capital first to derive an income. If you qualify under both the criteria then you can consider investing into these options. For income generation you need to invest into bank fixed deposits @ 7.5% with a capital of Rs 10 lakh. Avoid any speculation in stocks/ equities/ mutual funds.    If I have suffered a capital loss in mutual funds, can I offset this loss over the next 8 or 9 years on mutual funds, as is the case in real estate? -- Col Rahul Puri (retd)   The tax treatment would not be uniform in nature, if short term capital loss is arising from equity or debt mutual funds, i.e 12 months for equity and 36 months for debt, the loss can be carried forward for the next 8 assessment years. If long-term capital loss is arising from debt mutual funds, i.e 36 months, you can carry forward it for the next 8 assessment years. If long-term capital loss is arising from equity mutual funds, you cannot carry forward the loss since the gains are tax exempted.
