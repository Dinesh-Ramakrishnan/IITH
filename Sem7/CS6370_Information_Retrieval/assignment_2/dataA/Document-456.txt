  NEW DELHI: A selling spree in the heavyweight banking and IT sectors besides a poor start to European markets weighed heavy on domestic market sentiments on Friday, forcing the benchmark indices to end the week on a muted note.     The BSE Sensex dropped 46.44 points, or 0.17 per cent, to end the day at 28,077. Twenty of 30 index stocks ended lower for the day. The Nifty50 fell 6.35 points, or 0.07 per cent, to 8,666. Midcap and smallcap stocks gained.         The BSE Midcap index rose 0.52 per cent, while the BSE Smallcap index ended 0.45 per cent higher.         Friday blues and weak global markets kept the broader market subdued, said Anand James, Chief Market Strategist, Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services.       Shares of SBI surged 4.15 per cent to close at Rs 258.50 on BSE after the country's largest domestic lender announce share-swap details for the merger of five associate banks. Tata Steel, Cipla, Hindustan Unilever and L&T; were the other top gainers in the 30-stock pack, rising 1.32 per cent, 0.72 per cent, 0.61 per cent and 0.52 per cent, respectively.    Coal India ended the day as top index loser. The stock slid 1.36 per cent to close at Rs 334.20, extending the recent slide triggered by media reports that the government is likely to sell a 5-10 per cent stake in the company by March 2017.     SBBJ added 1.47 per cent to Rs 683.20. As per swap ratio for mega merger, SBI will give 28 of its shares for every 10 SBBJ shares. State Bank of Travancore climbed 6.17 per cent to Rs 537.05.

Investors of this bank will also receive 22 of SBI shares for every 10 shares held.    Shipping Corporation (SCI) tanked 4.92 per cent to Rs 70.60 after the company reported a 72.56 per cent drop in June quarter net profit at Rs 55.91 crore compared with the same period last year.     Indiabulls Housing Finance fell 0.43 per cent to Rs 800.25. The company plans to raise Rs 700 crore by issuing non-convertible debentures (NCDs) on a private placement basis.    Cairn India and Vedanta climbed 4.28 per cent and 3.68 per cent, respectively, after reports suggested that Vedanta's CEO is hopeful that the company can clinch Cairn India's merger deal with Vedanta.     Reuters adds:    The broader sentiment was hit, after New York Fed President William Dudley and San Francisco Fed President John Williams reiterated the case for raising interest rates in the coming months.     The MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.6 per cent,    The domestic equity indices were flat to slightly lower for the week as the recent momentum has slowed down due to a lack of meaningful drivers despite good buying by foreign investors.     "Though we are getting good inflows, a lot of people domestically are waiting for a correction. Profit taking is happening at all levels," said Neeraj Dewan, Director, Quantum Securities.     The Nifty50 gained 0.13 per cent to 8,683.95 after swinging between gains and losses. The Sensex ended 0.07 per cent higher at 28,142.82.
