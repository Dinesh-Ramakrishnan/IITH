Here's a look at six macro triggers that may impact the market today    Monsoon slacks off:  Southwest monsoon slacked off on its good run so far. The rains during the week were 28% below normal, wiping off the seasonal surplus. Monsoon from June 1 to August 17 was 606.2 millimetres, which was only normal. Till last week, rainfall was three% above normal. Dry weather over central and southern peninsular India seems to have offset excess rains. in its extended forecast up to September 3, the IMD said there will be below normal rainfall activity in many parts of east and northeast India. However, many parts of Central India will witness above normal rainfall activity and there will be increase in precipitation in northwest India.    Banking sector NPAs double in Q1:  The banking sector's non-performing assets (NPA) almost doubled to 8.5% in the first quarter of this fiscal, driven by surging bad assets of state-run lenders, Care Ratings said. The banking system's gross NPAs shot up to 8.5% by the June quarter, as against 4.6% a year ago. The spike was largely due to the doubling of NPAs at public sector banks to 10.4% compared to 5.3% in June 2015.    India Post Payments Bank set to roll out in a year:  India Post Payments Bank has received the certificate of incorporation from the Registrar of Companies, paving the way for the postal department's bank to begin operations in 2017 as announced. This will be the first public sector undertaking under the Department of Posts. The Department of Posts is expected to complete the roll out of its branches all over the country by September 2017. The government said this could be the fastest roll out for a bank anywhere in the world.    $380 million additional penalty on RIL:  The government has disallowed an additional $380 million of cost recovery to Reliance Industries for producing less than the targetted amount of natural gas from the KG-D6 field, the company has said in a market filing. Reliance Industries and partners BP Plc and Niko Resources are engaged in an arbitration with the government on how much cost the contractors can recover from the project. The production sharing contract (PSC) that governs the project allows Reliance and partners to deduct all capital and operating expenses before sharing profit with the government. But the government has objected to full deduction on ground flagging production didn't match the investment made.     Tax on unaccounted income now payable in cash as well:  Those disclosing unaccounted wealth under the income declaration scheme (IDS) will have the option of paying the tax on such income in cash, the income-tax department has clarified through a fifth set of frequently asked questions (FAQs). The I-T department has also said tax authorities will not question the valuation reports of the accredited valuers, clearing more doubts about the four-month long scheme that closes on September 30.    Review of 'Make in India' targets starts:  Twenty months after the launch of the Makein-India campaign, the government has begun assessing the impact of the PM Narendra Modi's flagship programme and is looking to even tweak some of the elements. "We have suggested to ministries that the programme can be reviewed and new elements brought in where there are good recommendations from the industry," industrial policy and promotion secretary Ramesh Abhishek said. The government is looking to promote local manufacturing across several sectors such as automobiles, auto parts, defence, leather, pharma and textiles through Make in India, which was announced by Modi in his Independence Day speech in 2014.     ...and in financial markets yesterday   Rupee down:  The rupee today ended lower by 5 paise at 66.81 per dollar on fresh demand from banks and importers for the US currency despite firm domestic equity markets. The rupee weakened even as the dollar fell against major global currencies.    Bonds down:  Government bonds (G-Secs) dropped further on selling pressure from banks and corporates.
