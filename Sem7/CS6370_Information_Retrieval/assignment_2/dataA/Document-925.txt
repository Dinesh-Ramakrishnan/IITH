  NEW DELHI: Hawkish signals from the US overwhelmed bullish developments back home on Thursday, and the bears grabbed the opportunity with both hands to pull the market down.     The outcome of the state assembly elections bolstered the ruling BJP on Thursday, raising hope that it will improve the chances of a reforms push. The market traded in the red throughout the day. The S&P; BSE Sensex, which slipped over 70 points in opening trade, ended the day 304 points down 25,399 while Nifty50, which hovered around its crucial support level of 7,850, closed at 7,783 down 86 points.

The US Fed's signals of a June rate hike made investors run for cover. The currency market was also bruised, as the rupee hit a fresh two-month low of 67.23 after the dollar index touched an eight-week high.     "Unless Nifty50 breaks the 7,800 level and trades decisively below it, I would say the signal is for no trade. Certainly, I do not want to be adventurous to buy the lows. I want to be careful with whatever longs I may have, because most people will have longs," said Dr CK Narayan, Founder, Chart Advise.     The top loser in the Sensex pack was Adani Ports, which was close to its 52-week low. The scrip ended 6.14 per cent lower after Moody's Investors Services cut its outlook on the stock to negative from stable. Other big losers included SBI (down 4.05 per cent), Larsen & Toubro (down 3.24 per cent), HDFC (down 2.75 per cent), and GAIL (down 2.71 per cent).     On the contrary, Lupin was the top gainer in the Sensex pack after it reported stellar numbers for the quarter ending March 2016. Its profit after tax surged 47.5 per cent at Rs 807 crore as compared to Rs 547 crore in the same quarter last fiscal. The other gainers included Wipro (up 0.70 per cent), Tata Motors (up 0.70 per cent), Maruti (up 0.32 per cent) and Hero MotoCorp (up 0.21 per cent).     Shares of JK Lakshmi Cement advanced 4.90 per cent after the company's standalone net profit soared 42.3 per cent (YoY) to Rs 48.38 crore for the March quarter.     Corporation Bank ended 4.35 per cent lower after posting a net loss of Rs 510.9 crore for the last quarter of 2015-16 fiscal. Castrol India ended 3.22 per cent lower. British Petroleum, the promoter of the company, will sell a stake worth Rs 2,000 crore in the company.     Torrent Power closed 11.36 per cent lower.

Market through the day: The S&P; BSE Sensex slipped over 300 points in Thursday morning trade ahead of outcome of assembly elections in the high-stakes Assembly elections in West Bengal, Kerala Tamil, Nadu, Puducherry and Assam.     The fall in the index was led by losses in HDFC Bank, HDFC, ITC, L&T;, and Axis Bank.     The Nifty50 was trading below its crucial psychological support level of 7,800 weighed down by losses in realty, oil & gas, metal, capital goods, banks, and power stocks.     "It's interesting to see Nifty squeezing in a range where supply is higher at 7,940 and we aren't able to close above it over the past three weeks and lows are getting pushed higher. Price action suggests the bulls are taking over the ground and a close above higher range will see faster price action. As per wave count, we will end current Neo-waves action if we break out of this range. The index is well supported by the PSU banks, metals and pharma stocks," said Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research.     The broader market outperformed the benchmark indices with BSE midcap and smallcap gaining 0.12 and 0.15 per cent, respectively.     Taking its losing streak to sixth trading session, the rupee fell 17 paise to touch a fresh two-month low of 67.14 against the US dollar on Thursday after minutes from the recent FOMC suggested June rate hike is on the cards.

Five things you need to know before the opening bell:   Election results to sway sentiment:  Counting of votes in the high-stakes Assembly elections in West Bengal, Kerala Tamil, Nadu, Puducherry and Assam will be out later in the day.     According to exit polls, Assam, Tamil Nadu and Kerala appeared to have voted for a change, giving BJP its first government in the northeastern state. DMK has been tipped to regain power trouncing AIADMK in Tamil Nadu.    Technical charts suggest cautious optimism:  Most technical analysts believe the market may see higher levels in the coming days. But technical charts are yet to show any concrete pattern.     "Technically, the market still remains above its medium-term support levels. The inherent bullishness of the market though has reached precipitous levels with most analysts and fund houses calling for higher levels. Excessive long buildup could lead to a short-term correction before the prevailing long-term uptrend commences," said Nikhil Kamath, Co-Founder & Director, Zerodha.     Kamath said, "The candlestick charts suggest confirmation of the bearish reversal Doji. However, it is still too early to see any confirmation to this pattern. We would still recommend staying cautiously optimistic over the long term while adding allocation to gold and fixed income in the short term."    Asian markets stay sentiment:  Most Asian markets were trading mixed this morning. Japan's benchmark Nikkei traded flat at 16,648. Other Asian indices, including South Korea's Kospi (down 0.56 per cent), China's Shanghai Composite (up 0.52 per cent) and Taiwan's TWSE (down 0.91per cent), traded mixed.    Earnings to generate stock-specific actions:  Stock-specific action is likely on the counters of companies that are scheduled to disclose their quarterly numbers during the day.     Investors will react to the earnings of Lupin, SpiceJet, Manpasand Beverages, Dishman Pharma, ICRA, Pidilite Industries and Rane Engine Value, which are among the 71 companies scheduled to announce their earnings during the day. The trading week will see 325 BSE-listed companies announcing March quarter earnings. Friday would be a hectic day with 99 scheduled results. Tuesday was relatively a calm day with 42 results.    US market ended mixed on Wednesday:  The Dow Jones industrial average inched 3.36 points, or 0.02 per cent, lower to 17,526.62. The S&P500; advanced 0.42 points, or 0.02 per cent, to settle at 2,047.63. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 23.39 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 4,739.12. The dollar rallied amid revived hopes that the US Fed could raise interest rates in June if economic data points to stronger US second-quarter economic growth along with higher inflation and employment, according to minutes from the US central bank's April policy meeting, Reuters reported.     Futures markets see the probability of an interest rate rise in June at 34 per cent, up from 15 per cent on Tuesday, and the likelihood of a July hike at 54 per cent, up from 33 per cent, according to CME FedWatch.
