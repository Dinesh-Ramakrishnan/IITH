  NEW DELHI: The S&P; BSE Sensex rose over 200 points in morning trade on Wednesday to reclaim its crucial level of 28,000, led by gains in ICICI Bank, Tata Motors, HDFC, Maruti Suzuki and TCS.     The Nifty50 also managed to reclaim 8,600 supported by gains in realty, power, oil & gas, metal, capital goods, and banking stocks.     At 09.20 AM, the 30-share index was trading at 28,075, up 101 points or 0.36 per cent. It touched a high of 28,089.49 and a low of 27,973.37 in morning trade.     The Nifty50 was trading at 8,619 up 28 points or 0.33 per cent. It touched a high of 8,632.65 and a low of 8,593.85 in the first 30 minutes of trade.     The S&P; BSE Midcap Index was up 0.76 per cent and BSE S&P; Smallcap Index was trading 0.64 per cent higher.     ICICI Bank (up 1.6 per cent), Tata Motors (up 1.5 per cent), Maruti Suzuki (up 1.2 per cent), State Bank of India (up 1.1 per cent), and Power Grid (up 0.88 per cent) were the major gainers on Sensex.     Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (down 8 per cent), Lupin (down 0.4 per cent), Sun Pharma (down 0.40 per cent), Tata Steel (down 0.20 per cent), and Coal India (down 0.17 per cent) were the major losers.   @8.00 AM:  Domestic equity indices are likely to open on flat on Wednesday, despite firm cues from Asian markets, ahead of the outcome of two-day US Fed meeting later today.    Bharti Airtel, HDFC, Bajaj Auto, Yes Bank, Dabur India, Torrent Pharma and Castrol India will be among the companies that will announce their June quarter numbers during the day.    F&O; rollovers at 41%:  Data showed market-wide F&O; rollovers stood at 41 per cent till Tuesday, compared with average rollovers of 45 per cent in the past three F&O; series. Nifty futures rollover, on the other hand, stood at 41 per cent on D-2, which was lower than the average rollovers of 46 per cent in last three F&O; series.    "  With the open interest base significantly higher, the last two sessions of July series become crucial in terms of what quantum of these positions get actually rolled over," Edelweiss Securities said in a note.    Cues from Singapore muted:  At 07:45 am, Nifty50 futures on the Singapore Stock Exchange were trading 3.50 points higher at 8,594.50, indicating a flat opening for the domestic market.     "The market appears expensive on most metrics of absolute valuation. Forward PE of 16.7 times is close to high. Earnings growth forecasts haven't improved. PB has expanded while RoE has not," BofA-Merrill Lynchsaid in a report.    Nifty50 forms bearish pattern on charts:  Some experts said the Nifty50 would face resistance at 8,640.     "On the daily charts, Nifty50 made a bearish Harami candle on Tuesday with the 8,640 level acting as a strong resistance. The Harami pattern emerges when there is a small bearish candlestick formation with the body of the candle completely inside the previous bullish candle. A bearish Harami signifies that the market is primarily characterised by bullish momentum, but it could deteriorate in the near term," said Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research.    Earnings to trigger stock-specific action:  A handful of companies are going to announce their March quarter earnings during the day, among them are Bharti Airtel, HDFC, Bajaj Auto, Yes Bank, Dabur India, Torrent Pharma and Castrol India.    A total of 328 BSE-listed companies are scheduled to report their numbers this week. Another 78 companies will announce theirs on Saturday. A host of PSU banks will announce earnings this week and analysts believe poor numbers, if any, could hurt market sentiment.    No Fed hike this time:  The consensus does not see a rate hike in the Fed policy outcome later on Wednesday and it is largely expected that the Fed may give weight to the geopolitical risks arising from the Brexit vote.     "The Fed is expected to acknowledge that the recent economic data has been positive, but it would be cautious at the same time. We think there is some risk in the market. What if they want to keep September as a live meeting and, therefore, would they actually sound a bit more hawkish than what people expect at this point," Badri Nivas of Citi India told ETNow.     According to CME Group's FedWatch tool, traders are pricing in a 26 per cent chance of a rate hike in September and a 56 per cent chance in December.    Asian markets stay higher:  Most Asian markets were trading higher this morning. Japan's benchmark Nikkei was trading 1.39 per cent higher at 16,611. China's Shanghai Composite rose 0.05 per cent to 3,050.22. Other Asian indices, including Hong Kong's Hang Seng (up 0.51 per cent), South Korea's Kospi (down 0.04 per cent) and Taiwan's TWSE (up 0.43 per cent), were trading higher.     "On measures of relative valuation, markets are at or only marginally above averages. Premiums to emerging markets are high, but they have been higher. Adjusted for growth forecasts, India's premium to China's equity market is still below average. Relative to domestic fixed income (GSEC, Corp bonds), equities are trading above average, but not by a large amount," said the BofA-Merrill Lynch report.    US markets ended flat on Tuesday:  The Dow Jones industrial average index dipped 0.1 per cent to end at 18,473.75 and the S&P500; index edged up 0.03 per cent to 2,169.18 after spending much of the day at a loss. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.24 per cent to 5,110.05, said a Reuters report.    All eyes would now be on outcome of the two-day Fed meet that began later Tuesday.
