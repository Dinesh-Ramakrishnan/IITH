  If 2014 was a year of redemption for equity funds, 2015 has turned out to be a no-show. This year, fixed income schemes led the performance charts in what has been a lacklustre year for both equities and gold. Only two specialized equity funds - those which invest in stocks of pharmaceutical companies and small-cap firms - have managed to beat fixed income funds so far in 2015.     Data show that during the year, ultra short-term, short-term, liquid funds and fixed maturity plans (FMPs) topped in returns, generating in excess of 8%. On the other hand, gold, which recorded double-digit gains between 2008 and 2012, offered negative returns for the third consecutive year. With the RBI resorting to interest rate cuts, yields on benchmark 10-year government securities fell during the current year. This pushed up bond prices, generating superior returns for the fixed income category.       If you had invested Rs 10,000 each in equity, fixed income and gold at the beginning of the year in respective mutual funds, as on December 28, an investment in the diversified equity MF would have been worth Rs 10,200, gold fund Rs 9,080 and fixed deposits (FDs) & fixed maturity plans (FMPs) about Rs 10,800. This gives an average portfolio return of just 0.26% during 2015. In comparison, the average returns in 2014 was 17% and just 0.4% in 2013.     Incidentally, the poor show by equity has come in a year when the benchmark sensex soared past the 30,000 mark for the first time ever. However, since the early-March record peak in sensex, as foreign fund-driven selling intensified, most broad-based indices slipped into the red. With just two more sessions to go in the current year, the sensex is down a little over 5% while the nifty is down slightly more than 4%.     With volatility remaining high in stock markets for most of the year, arbitrage funds, which take advantage of the difference between the cash and futures markets, have emerged as one of the top performers. These funds have gained 7.8% so far in 2015, compared to -2.1% return in large-cap funds and 1.9% gain in mid-cap funds.    Those equity funds which invest only in banking stocks were the worst performers during the year, showing negative 10.1% returns as the banking sector, as a whole, continued to struggle with high non-performing assets and prices of banking stocks lost substantial ground.
