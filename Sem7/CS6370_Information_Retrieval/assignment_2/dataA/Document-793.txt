  NEW DELHI: Strong global cues lifted the NSE's Nifty50 to a 15-month high on Monday, while investor sentiment also remained upbeat following the passage of the much-awaited goods and services tax (GST) bill by the Upper House of Parliament last week.    Markets the world over turned bullish after a solid jobs report released over the weekend bolstered expectations of an acceleration in US economic growth.     The S&P; BSE Sensex opened 100 points higher while the Nifty50 traded strong through the day and was comfortably perched above the psychologically important 8,700 mark.     Not once did the market slip into the red. That was certainly fodder for the bulls. However, there was not much bounce too, as the Sensex traded only in a 100-point range. The 30-share Sensex finally closed at 28,182.57, up 104.22 points or 0.37 per cent, while the broader Nifty50 settled at 8,711.35, up 28.20 points or 0.32 per cent. Nifty ended above 8,700 level for the first time since April 16, 2015.     The rally was broadbased, as the BSE Midcap index added a whopping 0.99 per cent while the BSE Smallcap index closed the day 0.71 per cent higher. The Sensex gained 0.37 per cent.       So what helped the equity benchmarks notch up these gains?     "This was more of a continuation of the ongoing trend even though the Nifty50 price momentum was probably softer compared with global markets or the Asian peers. It had more to do with the kind of continuation. Till the time Nifty50 holds on to the 8,700 (on Nifty) mark, there is no problem," said Kunal Bothra, Head Advisory, LKP.     Among others, shares of Adani Ports (up 2.80 per cent), HDFC (up 1.70 per cent), Reliance Industries (up 1.49 per cent), Dr Reddy's Laboratories (up 1.11 per cent) and Lupin (up 1.09 per cent) notched up solid gains in the Sensex pack.    Bharti Airtel was at the bottom of the index pack, as it lost 3.11 per cent followed by NTPC (down 1.36 per cent), Sun Pharma (down 1.12 per cent), ITC (down 0.58 per cent), Tata Motors (down 0.46 per cent) and ICICI Bank (down 0.35 per cent).          Energy stocks led the gains in the sectoral landscape. The BSE Oil and Gas index settled 1.54 per cent higher, led by gains in Hindustan Petroleum and BPCL. The BSE Energy index rose 1.40 per cent led by shares of Dolphin Offshore and HPCL.     The BSE Telecom index was the worst hit, as it tanked 2.30 per cent following reports that telecom companies may drag the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to court alleging regulatory bias.     In terms of specific stocks, Tata Coffee hit a three-year high as it gained 9.76 per cent after its June quarter profit after tax (PAT) surged 135.7 per cent year-on-year (YoY). Ahead of earnings, due later in the day, Idea Cellular gained xx per cent.     JK Cement jumped 2.51 per cent as its first quarter sales increased 9.2 per cent; PAT rose to Rs 61 crore from Rs 1 crore year-on-year. Amara Raja Batteries advanced xx per cent after Q1 sales surged 16.6 per cent and PAT rose 6.9 per cent YoY.     Britannia's consolidated PAT for Q1 jumped 13.15 per cent to Rs 219.13 crore from Rs 193.58 crore YoY and the stock rallied 9.38 per cent.     The PAT of Hero MotoCorp surged 18.4 per cent to Rs 883 crore. This helped the stock gain 0.66 per cent.    Wockhardt fell as much as 9.88 per cent after the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) banned import of products manufactured at its Ankleshwar plant for non-compliance of manufacturing norms.     Elsewhere in Asia, China's Shanghai Composite gained 0.93 per cent, Japan's Nikkei 2.44 per cent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng 1.57 per cent. At the time of writing of this report, London's FTSE100 was trading 0.15 per cent higher, while France's CAC40 was up 0.56 per cent and Germany's DAX 0.91 per cent.
