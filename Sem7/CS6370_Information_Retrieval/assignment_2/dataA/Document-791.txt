  NEW DELHI: Had it not been for index heavyweights such as HDFC, ITC, TCS and Reliance Industries, the S&P; BSE Sensex would have ended Thursday on a negative note.     Not that the market trajectory was anything to write home about, but it is suffice to say that the market ended with good gains, owing mainly to a surge in the last one hour.     The 30-share Sensex and the broader Nifty50 of NSE opened flat but turned volatile soon after as the equity benchmarks continued to swing between gains and losses.     The 30-stock pack gained as much as 127.51 points in intra-day trade before closing at 27,859.60, up 84.72 points or 0.31 per cent. The Nifty50 settled at 8,592.15, up 16.85 points or 0.20 per cent.           ITC contributed the most to the gains in the Sensex pack and ended 1.93 per cent higher. Among other top gainers, Lupin added 2 per cent, ICICI Bank 1.32 per cent, Reliance Industries 1.12 per cent and Asian Paints 1.12 per cent. Shares of Adani Ports fell 1.95 per cent after Wednesday's massive gains and ended as the second-biggest loser in the pack.     Among other losers were State Bank of India (down 2.03 per cent), M&M; (down 1.86 per cent), GAIL (down 1.11 per cent), and Sun Pharma (down 1.03 per cent).        On the Nifty50 index, shares of Bank of Baroda were hit really hard, as they lost 9.23 per cent after logging a 60 per cent fall in June quarter profit.     So what turned this market lacklustre? Bonds? Maybe. Ten-year bond yields touched their lowest since 2009 in intra-day trade. In the commodities space, oil prices fell after strong US crude inventories and rising output in Saudi Arabia came back to haunt the market.     Add to this, the mixed earnings reported for the June quarter so far. And all of this probably contributed to the slowdown in equities.     Experts, however, attributed it to profit taking.     "If the equity rally continues, it cannot be without the participation of banking stocks and the numbers coming out from the PSU banks are not very encouraging. I think the stage was already set for some amount of profit taking," said Sanjay Sinha, Founder, Citrus Advisors.     In the sectoral landscape, FMCG stocks saw the maximum gains as the BSE FMCG index closed 1.44 per cent higher, thanks to gains in Bombay Burmah Trading Corp and WaterBase. Realty stocks were in pain, with the BSE Realty index losing 0.90 per cent led by losses in shares of DLF and NBCC.            Among specific stocks, Grasim Industries fell 6.44 per cent ahead of June quarter results scheduled to be released later in the day.     Shares of Yes Bank fell 0.96 per cent amid reports that the private lender will soon roll out a $1 billion fund raising plan.    Infrastructure firm Dilip Buildcon surged 15.05 per cent over issue price of Rs 219 in debut trade.     Shares of IDBI Bank rose 2.40 per cent after it reported a 78% jump in June quarter profit.     Elsewhere in Asia, China's Shanghai Composite lost 0.53 per cent, Japan's Nikkei 0.18 per cent while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 0.39 per cent.     At the time of writing of this report, London's FTSE100 was trading 0.45 per cent lower, while France's CAC40 was up 0.28 per cent and Germany's DAX 0.26 per cent.
