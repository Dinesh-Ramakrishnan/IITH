  NEW DELHI: When the US Fed sneezes, equity markets across the world catch a fever. This is what happened on Wednesday.     US Federal Reserve member William Dudley hinted at a possible rate hike in September and Asian, US and European markets all took a beating.     The domestic market was not behind. The equity benchmarks opened flat and traded cautiously through the day but eventually ended with losses.     The 30-share Sensex still managed to hold above the psychologically important 28,000 mark, while the 50-share Nifty50 slipped about 18 points.          The broader market again bucked the trend, with the BSE Midcap index gaining 0.69 per cent and the Smallcap rising 0.55 per cent.     "If Nifty slips below the 8,600 mark, the risk-reward for going contrarian may become lucrative. In the last five or six days, we have hardly had any great sectoral participation. That is why it becomes difficult for the index to break out. But it still remains a buy-on-dips market, if you are an index trader. However, there are a lot of opportunities in midcap and largecap stocks," said Kunal Bothra, market expert.    IT stocks contributed most of the fall as index heavyweights Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services lost 1.67 per cent and 2.51 per cent, respectively. Adani Ports (down 2.34 per cent), Power Grid (down 1.69 per cent), Wipro (down 1.40 per cent) and Asian Paints (down 1.41 per cent) were the other losers in the Sensex pack.    Tata Steel (up 3.20 per cent), Coal India (up 2.90 per cent), Bajaj Auto (up 1.99 per cent), Hero MotoCorp (up 1.98 per cent) and Axis Bank (up 1.14 per cent) were the biggest gainers.        In the sectoral landscape, IT stocks lost 1.67 per cent led by losses in 3I Infotech and Aurionpro Solutions. The BSE Metal index saw heavy gains thanks to SAIL (up 4.45 per cent) and NMDC (up 3.50 per cent).        The biggest event of the day was the merger deal between Zee Learn and Tree House Education, helping the stocks gain 11.26 per cent and 15.51 per cent, respectively. Boards of both the firms approved a revised share-swap ratio on Wednesday for the planned merger.    Reliance Industries fell 1 per cent after the petroleum ministry slapped a $250 million penalty on the company. OCL India surged xx per cent after the company's net profit jumped 95.7 per cent to Rs 105.84 crore.     Piramal Enterprises' shares surged 3.64 per cent, after the company said on Tuesday that its unit in the US would buy contract development and manufacturing company Ash Stevens.     Elsewhere in Asia, China's Shanghai Composite closed 0.02 per cent lower while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 0.48 per cent. Japan's Nikkei gained 0.90 per cent.     At the time of writing of this report, London's FTSE100 was trading 0.02 per cent higher, but Germany's DAX was down 0.66 per cent France's CAC40 0.38 per cent.     (Images: BSE)
