  MUMBAI: Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani has left his salary unchanged for the eight consecutive year, taking home less than half of what he was authorised to in fiscal 2016.     While the nation's richest man, who is also the company's managing director, got a salary of Rs 15 crore last year, RIL increased the remuneration of its other whole-time directors.     "The chairman and managing director's compensation has been set at Rs 15 crore as against Rs 38.75 crore as approved, reflecting his desire to continue to set a personal example for moderation in managerial compensation levels," RIL said in its annual report for 2015-16.     Although Ambani's salary remained unchanged, he is eligible for a hefty dividend from the company on his shareholding.     While most of the company''s whole-time directors had seen a decline in salaries in fiscal 2016, last year was a better one for them.     The remuneration of executive director PMS Prasad increased to Rs 7.23 crore in the year ended March 31, 2016 from Rs 6.03 crore the previous year.     Executive Director Nikhil Meswani took home Rs 14.42 crore, higher than the Rs 12.03 crore he earned in fiscal 2015. Executive Director Hital Meswani's remuneration was Rs 14.41 crore, compared with Rs 12.03 crore a year earlier.     Another executive director, Pawan Kumar, got Rs 2.94 crore, compared with Rs 2.41 crore in fiscal 2015.
