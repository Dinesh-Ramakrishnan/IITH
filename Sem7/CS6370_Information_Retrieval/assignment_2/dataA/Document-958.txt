 In a chat with ET Now, Mayuresh Joshi, Fund Manager, Angel Broking, says EPC plus BOT is something that is going to be very interesting going forward   ET Now: Which are the infra names that interest you because even in Wednesday's session there were these limited infrastructure names which were doing rather well for themselves. Today a J Kumar Infra has started off well. Anything in the pure construction space which interests you?   Mayuresh Joshi:  No. If I break that as construction/infrastructure, EPC theme is something that we are probably liking for the rest of this year and clearly in this space we are working with stalled projects which are probably getting underway; new projects are coming through specifically on the roads and highway side; a lot of companies catering to this part of this business are expected to do well. Once the order flow starts coming in, execution will be a worry for a lot of these companies. As execution starts improving over the next few quarters, it is a mix of how it plays for a lot of these EPC guys. So I think, EPC plus BOT is something that is going to be very interesting going forward. The roads minister has put it very clearly that if he puts through an hybrid annuity model specifically on the BOT side, equity will improve significantly for a lot of these companies. So EPC as a theme is something that we are probably liking. Within the EPC players, we have remained extremely optimistic on players like KNR Construction and MBL Infra.
