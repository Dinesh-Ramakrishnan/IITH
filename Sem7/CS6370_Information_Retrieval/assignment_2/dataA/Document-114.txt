  MUMBAI: Leading department store chains such as Shoppers Stop, Lifestyle, Pantaloon and Max will stock Pokemon-related merchandise during the upcoming festive season to cash in on the popularity of augmented reality game Pokemon Go.     The location-based smartphone game, developed by American software company Niantic, requires players to walk around neighbourhoods to capture, battle, and train virtual creatures, called Pokemon, who appear on the screen as if they were in the same realworld location as the player.     "There is a huge trend in the market towards such characters and kids drive their parents to buy such products," said Jacob John, COO of Lifestyle. "Kids are the decision makers and they love Pokemon. So, it's a great business opportunity for us." Animation and animationrelated merchandise has always been a preserve of kids, and also a money spinner for enterprises.     But Pokemon Go, with its sense of nostalgia, has even caught the attention of adults. This in turn has created a huge demand for merchandise in the adult space across categories like apparel, accessories, electronic accessories for phones and computers.     "The game is expected to be officially launched in India sometime around September-October, which is when most of the marketing and promotional activity will hit the ground," said Jiggy George, founder of Dream Theatre, the agency that owns licensing and merchandise rights for Pokemon in India and South Asia. Until now, people in India have been downloading the game file online. The company is expecting to do retail sales worth 100 crore over the next two years.     "Right now, what you are seeing is residual. What is happening around the world is capturing India. For when the game officially launches in India, the potential is huge," George said.     The size of the licensing and merchandising industry in India is estimated at Rs 4,000 crore, but is largely unorganised. Accounting for about 4% of the global industry, the Indian market is evolving rapidly and experts say co-branding is an effective way of introducing products into another brand's loyal consumer franchise. But it won't be easy. The only company that has made a mark with its merchandise in the last few years is Green Gold, which sells 'Chota Bheem' merchandise primarily because of its popularity on the small screen.     No wonder not all retailers are rushing in. "We are rolling out our Pokemon merchandise in spring next year. We don't mind being a couple of months late, because we know we'll be able to catch on the wave once we see early uptake happening," said Vasanth Kumar, ED, Max Fashion. Sales shoot up to 30-50% whenever special merchandise is introduced, he said.     According to SurveyMonkey Intelligence, a mobile application analytics company, there have been more than 30 million downloads of the game in the US alone. Globally, pubs, coffee houses and restaurants are trying to attract customers using 'lure modules' that allow users to lure Pokemon's to a particular location for the next 30 minutes.
