  NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market on Wednesday logged losses for the second consecutive session in a week, a day after RBI maintained status quo on policy rate.     The domestic market slipped into the red in the wake of flat closing on Wall Street in overnight trade and a mixed performance in Asian markets.     As investors booked profits, equity benchmarks fell, thanks to losses in index heavyweights such as HDFC, Infosys and ITC.     The S&P; BSE Sensex opened 50 points higher, but quickly slipped into the red. The Nifty50 held above the 8,650 level, but soon started trending in the negative zone.     The 30-share Sensex lost 310.28 points in intra-day trade before closing at 27,774.88. India VIX claimed 2.64 per cent, as the Nifty50 settled at 8,575.30, down 102.95 points or 1.19 per cent.          Lupin experienced maximum pain, as it ended at the bottom of the Sensex pack with a loss of 4.08 per cent. Reliance Industries (down 2.70 per cent), M&M; (down 2.59 per cent), ICICI Bank (down 2.57 per cent), and Hero MotoCorp (down 2.56 per cent) were the top laggards.     Only four Sensex stocks ended with gains. Adani Ports made the most of a dull day, as it added 7.70 per cent after reported 31 per cent jump in consolidated profit for June quarter. Tata Consultancy Services (up 0.88 per cent), Coal India (up 0.34 per cent) and ONGC (up 0.04 per cent) were among the other Sensex gainers.        The broader market declined in line with the equity benchmarks with the BSE Midcap declining 1.06 per cent and the Smallcap index 1.18 per cent.     Among specific stocks, shares of M&M; tanked 2.59 per cent despite reporting a 16 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in net profit to Rs 962 crore.         Shares of Lupin fell 3.89 per cent even after the drugmaker reported a 55 per cent rise in first quarter profit.         Birla Group unit Aditya Birla Nuvo fell 4.07 per cent while Grasim Industries lost 6.10 per cent on reports that the parent company plans to merge the two.          JK Tyre Industries fell 3.04 per cent after reporting a 14.35 per cent drop in net profit for June quarter. Shares of NIIT Tech fell xx per cent amid reports that COO Sudhir Chaturvedi had resigned.        Glenmark lost 2 per cent despite getting ANDA approval for Triamcinolone Acetodine Cream.        In the sectoral landscape, the BSE Oil and Gas index was the worst performer, down 2.19 per cent led by losses in shares of IndianOil and HPCL.         The BSE Bankex closed 1.36 per cent lower, led by losses in shares of Punjab National Bank and ICICI Bank.        Elsewhere in Asia, China's Shanghai Composite slipped 0.23 per cent and Japan's Nikkei 0.18 per cent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index, however, gained 0.12 per cent.     In Europe, London's FTSE100 was trading 0.02 per cent lower at the time of writing of this report, while France's CAC40 and Germany's DAX were down 0.10 per cent and 0.23 per cent, respectively.
