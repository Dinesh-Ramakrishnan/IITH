  NEW DELHI: Mobile handset company Ringing Bells today claimed that it has started delivering 65,000 more units of the world's cheapest smartphone priced at Rs 251 apiece.     A fortnight ago the company claimed to have started off with the delivery of 5,000 units of Freedom 251.    "Ringing Bells is all set to fulfill its promise of delivering 2 lakh smartphones to the customers by starting the delivery process of 65,000 more units," the company said in a statement.     The process is cash on delivery where customers will pay only after they receive the desired unit, the statement said.     The deliveries were made in states - West Bengal, Haryana, Himachal, Bihar, Uttarakhand, New Delhi, Punjab, J&K;, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.     "We started the process of lottery few days back, and now are dispatching the units to the people. We are elated with the response that we have got for the delivered units. Our target is the low income people who fancy the chances to own a smartphone. We wish to fulfill their dreams soon," Ringing Bells spokesperson said.    With the delivery of current 65,000 units the overall delivery of Freedom 251 will now stand at 70,000 units across India, the statement said.
