  NEW DELHI: The bulls made an impressive comeback on Dalal Street last week and look set to regain control, but the forthcoming RBI money policy, the rate-setting meeting of the US Federal Reserve and the Brexit referendum are expected to cap the upside.     Muted price action towards the weekend should ideally be interpreted as a 'breather' or a 'pause' after such a remarkable rally in the previous week. The Nifty50 closed the week above its crucial resistance level of 8,200.     During the week, Nifty50 formed a series of 'small body' candles on the daily chart. Such candles, particularly after a strong rally, are often an indication of exhaustion in the market or possibility of an imminent profit booking wave, say experts.     "We would advise investors not to exit longs and suggest against the creation of short positions in this market. The premise behind this opinion is the strong trend that the market is showing after surpassing the 8,000 mark," Sameet Chavan, Technical Analyst at Angel Broking, told ETMarkets.com.     "Technically speaking, we expect this momentum to continue as long as the Nifty50 manages to sustain above the 'five-day EMA' on a closing basis. This technical tool is now placed at 8,175," he said.     The index is likely to trade in a range but a lot of individual stocks are showing potential to outperform.    Going by the buzz on the Street, we have collated a list of eight stock trading strategies for the next 5-10 trading sessions:      Analyst: Rohit Gadia, Founder & CEO, CapitalVia Global Research   Divi's Laboratories: Buy | Stop loss: Rs 1,120 | Target price: Rs 1,180| Duration: 5 sessions    The stock is in a strong uptrend on its daily chart and is also trading above its both short and medium term moving averages of 10 and 50-day periods. After a brief consolidation, the stock has started to move up again.     The stock has an important resistance level which is placed at Rs 1,150. "We expect it to gain its upside momentum with the crossing of the mentioned resistance mark, where the stock may test the level of 1180, buy with the stop loss of 1120," said Gadia.    Marico: Buy | Stop loss: Rs 248 | Target price: Rs 265| Duration: 5 sessions    After a short-term consolidation, the stock has seen a breakout on the daily charts. It is likely to show an upward movement if it crosses the Rs 256 level and manages to stay above the immediate support at Rs 248.     The stock has bounced back from its 50-day moving average, indicating strength. One may initiate long position on the stock for the target of Rs 265, with a stop loss at Rs 248.    Jubliant FoodWorks: Sell | Stop loss: Rs 1,030 | Target price: Rs 950 | Duration: 5 sessions    The stock is on a downtrend on its daily chart and is trading below its short-term and medium-term moving averages of 10- and 50-day periods. The stock is consolidating near its important support at Rs 1,000.     A move below its resistance at Rs 1,000 will likely bring downside momentum in the stock. One can initiate sell for a target of Rs 950 with the stop loss of Rs 1030.    NTPC: Buy | Stop loss: Rs 145 | Target price: Rs 160| Duration: 5 sessions    The trend on the counter is extremely bullish and the stock is consolidating near the resistance mark of Rs 150 over the past few trading sessions.     The stock is trading above its short and medium term moving averages of 10 and 50 days. "We may expect it to show upside momentum with the crossing of the mentioned resistance mark, where the stock may test the level of 160. Buy with the stop loss of 145," said Gadia.    CESC: Buy | Stop loss: Rs 545 | Target price: Rs 570| Duration: 5 sessions    The stock is trading above its 50-day moving averages in its daily chart which indicates the presence of a strong uptrend. After a strong rally, the stock has pulled back recently.     However, it bounced back from its support at Rs 535 and has resumed its uptrend. The short term resistance is placed at Rs 555. A move above this level can trigger further momentum further, where long can be initiated for the target of Rs 570 with the stop loss of Rs 545.    Analyst: Sameet Chavan, Technical Analyst at Angel Broking   Godrej Industries: Buy | Stop loss: Rs 340 | Target price: Rs 382| Duration: 5-10 sessions    In the recent corrective move, the stock managed to take a support near the 50 per cent retracement of the previous upward move from Rs 288 to Rs 380. At present, prices are showing strength from the retracement support and are moving higher with an increase in volumes.     The 'RSI' indicator has given a positive crossover from its support zone of 40; indicating positive momentum. "Combining these evidence, we expect a breakout from the near-term congestion zone in the upward direction," Chavan said.     "Thus, we advise traders to buy the stock at current levels and on declines up to Rs 353 for a target of Rs 382. The stop loss for the trade set-up can be kept at Rs 340," he said.    Reliance Infrastructure: Buy | Stop loss: Rs 498 | Target price: Rs 578 | Duration: 5-10 sessions    After the sideways consolidation, the stock had recently given a breakout from the 'Falling Channel' pattern. In the last three trading sessions, prices have corrected and have pulled back towards the channel, which should now act as a support.     The 'Super Trend' indicator on the daily chart is in a buy mode and thus, the pullback move should be used as a buying opportunity. "We are expecting the stock to resume the short term uptrend and at current prices, the risk to reward ratio is favourable for long positions," Chavan said.     "Hence, we advise traders to buy the stock at current levels and on declines up to Rs 520 for a target of Rs 572. The stop loss for the trade set-up can be kept at Rs 498," he said.    Bajaj Auto: Buy | Stop loss: Rs 2,540 | Target price: Rs 2,840 | Duration: 5-10 sessions    This stock has been one of the outperforming stocks within the 'Automobiles' space along with its peers. After forming a very good chart structure, the stock is on the verge of hitting its new all-time high.     The weekly 'Super Trend' indicator is in a 'Buy' mode along with the 'RSI-Smoothened' surpassing the 70 mark, which is an extremely bullish sign. "Considering the positive hourly chart structure, we expect a continuation of this upward leg in the near term," Chavan said.     "Thus, we advise traders to buy this stock from current level to a decline up to Rs 2,630 for a target of Rs 2,840 in coming five to 10 trading sessions. The stop loss for this trade set up can be kept at Rs 2,540," he said.     (Views and recommendations expressed in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of EconomicTimes.com.
