  KOLKATA: Mohit Kampani, managing director of Spencer's Retail has resigned, two senior industry executives said. This is the second occasion Kampani put in his papers, after his resignation around a year ago was not accepted, the executives said. This time around, Kampani's decision has been accepted and he will continue until July. The flagship retail business of the RPSanjiv Goenka group is on the lookout for Kampani's replacement.     The industry buzz is that Kampani decided to move on as he was not able to perform independently and had differences of opinion with the promoters. Incidentally, Sanjiv Goenka's son Shashwat, 26, was made de facto head of Spencer's around three years ago and was mentored by Kampani, the executives said.     An email sent to Shashwat Goenka and RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group did not elicit any response till Tuesday press time. When contacted, Kampani too declined to comment. His resignation was announced internally in the group on Monday. Kampani had joined Spencer's Retail in 2007 as vice-president (operations) and became president and chief executive officer in 2012 after the resignation of then chief Vineet Kapila.     Kampani, along with Shashwat Goenka, was instrumental in trimming down losses by shutting down unviable stores, moving out of unprofitable markets like Mumbai, expanding presence with large-format hypermarkets and focusing on non-food merchandise, which have higher margins. He had also led the company's online foray which led to the acquisition of meragrocer.com in December.     Spencer's had last year hired two senior professionals â Vipin Bhandari who was the CEO at HyperCity Retail and joined as deputy CEO, while Nitu Jaiswal was roped from Walmart India as the marketing head. However, no decision has been taken on whether Bhandari will succeed Kampani.
