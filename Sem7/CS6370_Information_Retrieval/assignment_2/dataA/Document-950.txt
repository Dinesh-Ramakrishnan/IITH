  NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market surged on Tuesday, reacting to exit polls that showed gains for the ruling BJP in the just-concluded assembly elections, a fresh bounce in crude oil prices and solid trade in US markets in overnight trade.     Right from the word go, the market rejoiced on a slew of good triggers and the benchmark Sensex rallied as much as 270 points at one point, before paring gains and ending the day at 25,773, up 120 points.     For a detailed account of every small or big move in the market through the day, click here     The Nifty50 reclaimed its crucial psychological level of 7,900, but ended lower at 7,890, up 30 points.     ONGC (up 3.72 per cent), Axis Bank (up 3.32 per cent) and HDFC (up 2.44 per cent) were the top gainers in the Sensex pack, while the top losers included NTPC (down 2.18 per cent), Hindustan Unilever (down 1.38 per cent), Adani Ports (down 1.29 per cent), HDFC Bank (down 0.81 per cent)and Tata Motors (down 0.68 per cent).     Global markets were fairly strong, but what made the investors bullish was a fresh jump in crude prices on supply shortage in Nigeria and Canada. Brent crude touched $49.47 in intra-day trade and was up 2 cents at $48.99 at 0840 GMT.     The market gave up some of its gains towards the end of the session, and this made some experts unsure of the momentum.     "We have been maintaining that the index is finding it difficult to trade. This two-day upward move looks slightly stronger but, I think, the 7,950-7,980 range till the 8,000 level is filled with multiple supply zones. I am not sure if we will cross them immediately or take another pause and go back into the range," said Mitesh Thacker, Technical Analyst, miteshthacker.com.     There was also a rally in oil and gas stocks. The BSE Oil and Gas index advanced 1.18 per cent after Goldman Sachs said the crude market will slip into a deficit mode sooner than it had expected. ONGC, Oil India and Cairn led the rally in the index.     The realty counter witnessed hectic buying, lifting the Realty index 0.79 per cent higher. DB Realty and Indiabulls Real Estate were the top gainers in the index.     In terms of specific stocks, the star of the session was Sun TV, which is related to the DMK party. It gained 9.76 per cent in trade after exit polls showed the DMK-Congress coalition will form the next government in Tamil Nadu. Kalanithi Maran, chairman of Sun Group, is the grandnephew of DMK chief M Karunanidhi.     Shares of Sobha Ltd rose 0.73 per cent, after jumping 4 per cent in intra-day trade.. The company's board will consider buyback of equity on May 19. Top brokerage JPMorgan has maintained an overweight rating on the stock.     Shares of Motherson Sumi rose 8.36 per cent after it reported 18.3 per cent rise in consolidated profit after tax for the March quarter at Rs 414 crore against Rs 350 crore in the year-ago period.     Shares of Advani Hotels & Resorts rose 19.98 per cent, after hitting the upper circuit at Rs 57.65 earlier in the day.

Market through the day:  The S&P; SBE Sensex surged over 100 points in morning trade on Tuesday led by gains in HDFC, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Infosys, L&T;, and ITC.     The Nifty50 reclaimed its crucial psychological level of 7,900 supported by gains in realty, power, oil & gas, metal, capital goods, and banking stocks.     "The market is trading in a range. This range is getting narrower as we speak. If you look at global charts, especially Dow Jones, Friday's selloff was something very critical because it broke some very serious supports on its way. So the global pressure was probably the only spoilsport for the Nifty50 in the last two months. If the market stabilises, you could probably see some more upside over the next couple of days," said Kunal Bothra , Head Advisory LKP.     The broader market traded in line with benchmark indices with the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices gaining 0.52 and 0.46 per cent, respectively.

Tata Motors (down 0.46 per cent), HUL (down 0.4 per cent), Adani Ports (down 0.32 per cent) and Wipro (down 0.04 per cent) were the major Sensex losers.   Four things you must know about today's trade:   Technical charts still positive:  The benchmark equity indices gained on Monday even as global and domestic cues were largely negative.     "The broader market participation shows that gains on Monday were a clear-cut pullback from lower levels," said Shrikant Chouhan, Senior VP - Technical Research, Kotak Securities.     "The Nifty50 has not broken an important level of 7,720 since last three-four days. This particular level is having a lot of importance since the beginning of April. So I think till the time the market is not breaking this level, we can again see the 7,920-7,950 levels on the higher side," Chouhan said.     "At this point of time, we can keep a stop loss at 7,800 or 7,820 and we can continue with long positions on the Nifty50," the expert said.    Asian markets stay mixed:  Asian markets were trading mixed this morning. Japan's benchmark Nikkei traded 0.90 per cent higher at 16,615.11. Other Asian indices, including South Korea's Kospi (down 0.06 per cent), China's Shanghai Composite (down 0.28 per cent) and Taiwan's TWSE (up 0.05 per cent), traded mixed.    Earnings to generate stock-specific actions:  Stock-specific actions are likely on the counters of companies that are scheduled to disclose their quarterly numbers during the day.     Investors will react to the earnings of Motherson Sumi, United Bank, Syndicate Bank, Voltas, Mahindra Holidays, Gujarat Gas and GSK Consumer Healthcare, among others, which are scheduled to announce their earnings during the day.     The trading week will see 325 BSE-listed companies announcing their March quarter numbers. Friday would be a hectic day with 99 scheduled results. Tuesday, on the other hand, will be relatively calm with 42 results.     "Our hope is that if monsoon is good, even rural demand should recover. So overall, we think a 15-20 per cent earnings growth is definitely a possibility for the year as a whole and that should lead to a good upside in the market from this point onward," said Varun Goel, Vice President & Fund Manager, PMS, Motilal Oswal AMC.    US market ended higher on Monday:  The Dow Jones industrial average rose 175.39 points, or 1 per cent, to settle at 17,710.70 on Monday.
