  J Kumar Infraprojects' results for the fourth quarter of 2015-16 have been lacklustre. Compared to the same period last year, the company's fourth quarter revenue and net profit remained flat, because of delays in order execution and accounting for revenue (revenue recognition). Problems related to land compensation issues in some National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) road projects is the main reason behind the delays. The company's performance for the first quarter of 2016-17 is also expected to be on similar lines.     However, analysts are getting bullish on this counter because its longterm prospects remain bright. The central government continues to focus on the infrastructure, especially on power, railways and roads. A higher capital expenditure on roads and railways will benefit J Kumar Infra, given 72% of its revenue and 90% of its orders are from the transportation sector. The NHAI has awarded 4,400 km of projects in 2015-16 and is expected to award around 6,500-7,000 km in 2016-17. Similarly, Indian railways has embarked upon a massive capex plan of around Rs 8.5 lakh crore to regain its lost market share. It spent Rs 94,000 crore in 2015-16, up 44% from 2014-15, and is expected to increase it to Rs 1.2 lakh crore in 2016-17.      Though J Kumar Infra's long-term outlook is bright, in the recent past, the company hasd received some bad press. For example, an inquiry panel of Bombay Municipal Corporation (BMC) has found deficiency in 34 road projects implemented by private contractors and has suggested action against them. According reports, J Kumar is also one of them. J Kumar Infra's share price has almost halved and has hit new 52 week lows due to a lacklustre performance and blacklisting worries.     However, analysts feel that the market has already discounted the rid of blacklisting. Also, there is no risk of it being blacklisted for non-BMC projects. For example, J Kumar Infra-China Rail Tunnel Group (CRTG) joint venture recently won orders worth Rs 5,012 crore from the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation. This has boosting the company's order book significantly to Rs 8,846 crore. Since its current order book is 6.3-times its 2015-16 revenues, it lends decent revenue visibility in the years to come. Also, with a strong balance sheetânet debt-equity ratio of only 0.14-timesâ the company should be able to speedup execution, once the external problems are solved.        Selection Methodology  We pick the stock that has shown the maximum increase in 'consensus analyst rating' in the past one month. Consensus rating is arrived at by averaging all analyst recommendations after attributing weights to each of them (5 for strong buy, 4 for buy, 3 for hold, 2 for sell and 1 for strong sell) and any improvement in consensus analyst rating indicates that the analysts are getting more bullish on the stock. To make sure that we pick only companies with decent analyst coverage, this search is restricted to stocks that are covered by at least 10 analysts. You can see similar consensus analyst rating changes during the past week in the ETW 50 table.
