  MUMBAI: In order to provide adequate support to help balance employees' role as parents along with their work commitments, Ericsson India- a leading global ICT player- has extended paid maternity leaves to 26 weeks. The Company will also offer the same benefits in case of adoption if the child is less than one year old.     The policy benefits have been extended towards providing greater flexibility to employees, by enabling them to have better work life balance. The company has also doubled the paternity leaves from 5 days of paid leaves to 10 days.    Sameer Khanna, VP and Head of Human Resource, Region India, Ericsson, said in a statement: "At Ericsson, we believe in creating an environment that is conducive to the personal and professional growth of all employees. By extending maternity benefits, we want to ensure that our women employees are more comfortable and motivated returning back to work from the maternity break."     Ericsson is committed to creating a more inclusive work environment and carries out various programs under its "Blue River Project" initiative to create a more inclusive work environment. Under the Blue River Project initiative, the Company regularly invites leaders and achievers to share their thoughts with employees on breaking gender myths. The Company also organizes 'Unconscious bias' trainings for its people managers from time to time.
