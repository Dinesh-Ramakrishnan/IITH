  NEW DELHI: Getit Infoservices has frozen operation of its ecommerce websites - AskMe Bazaar, Mebelkart and AskMe Grocery as majority shareholder in the company Astro Entertainment Networks Ltd (AENL) shareholder said "there is little prospect for turnaround and the business is insolvent".     AENL said that it intends to appoint a forensic auditor to review Getit's books and will take appropriate steps based on the results of that audit.     "AENL has always been a responsible and patient investor in Getit over the last six years making every effort possible to support the business even as other investors withdrew," it said in a statement on Friday.     While the portals still exist, transactions are not taking place on all three of them.        "We are not accepting any orders at this moment. We will be back soon." a message on all the three portals read.     Getit, which now owns AskMe, has been tottering financially following a feud between its owner, Astro, and its minority shareholders. Despite a huge marketing push even after hiring highly paid brand ambassadors such as Ranbir Kapoor, Farhan Akhtar and Kangana Ranaut, it failed to get the required traction and customer base.     Apart from AskMe Bazaar, AskMe Grocery, Mebelkart, the company has also owns AskMePay's AskMeFin.     Employees and sellers on the platforms have been complaining of non-payment of dues in the last few months.     A battle of sorts was brewing between the minority shareholders and Astro since early this year over financial issues. The minority shareholders had earlier alleged that Astro has not cleared dues worth Rs 300 crore and is exiting from the company, while Astro had cited AskMe's inability to meet its plans due to lack of scale and difficult times in Indian ecommerce market, among other factors.     A spokesperson for AskMe declined to comment on the shutdown, but said, "They (Astro) have been harassing, intimidating and threatening top employees to aid in their illegal acts, which they have resisted, and due to this they have resigned. Employees have given an offer for management buyout (MBO) to save the company and various new options, which Astro is trying to block and place totally unreasonable demands from the management and their new backers. We request Indian authorities to ask Astro to pay their dues as per the written commitments and let the MBO happen for the future of the company."     Astro which held 98.5% stake in Getit Infoservices, did not attend the board meeting which was held on August 8.     Minority shareholders have also alleged that Astro is going back on its commitments for a management buyout because of which the company was unable to pay salaries of employees and dues of sellers on the platform.
