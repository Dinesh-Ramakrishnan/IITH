  GUWAHATI: India ramped up its air capability on the eastern frontier on Friday as three Sukhoi-30 MKI air dominance fighter aircraft made their maiden landing at a refurbished advanced landing ground (ALG) at Pasighat in Arunachal Pradesh, barely 100 km from the Chinese border. This is the first ALG for fighter aircraft in India.     The IAF's Russian-made frontline fighter jets touched down on the plains of Pasighat in a 'historic first'.The ALG in Pasighat, in the predominantly hilly state, is now the closest to China. Pasighat will also be used by the US-built C-130J Super Hercules aircraft.     Pasighat is the fifth reconstructed ALG in Arunachal Pradesh. The strategically located ground was built during the Sino-India war of 1962 and remained unused after the war. After the bitter war, that saw huge casualties on the Indian side, China often claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of its territory . China has as many as 15 such ALGs along the McMahon Line, the imaginary line dividing the two countries. China refuses to acknowledge its validity.This line is now known as the Line of Actual Control.     The IAF said, "The ALG at Pasighat will facilitate air connectivity with the rest of the country and boost tourism in Arunachal. The pristine and picturesque landscape of Pasighat, on the banks of the river Siang, will be accessible to the rest of the world."
