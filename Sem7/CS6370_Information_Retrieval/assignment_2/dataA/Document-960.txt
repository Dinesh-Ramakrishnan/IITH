  By: Kiran Somvanshi    ET Intelligence Group: From being the best performing stock in the fast moving consumer goods space in the past three months, Nestle India has now become one of the most downgraded ones in the sector after its June quarter show. At least six major brokerages have downgraded their recommendations on the stock citing the valuations are ahead of earnings.     The stock had gained nearly 30% in the second quarter. It was just 1.5% short of breaching its record high of Rs 7,499. However, a disappointing performance has made the Street reevaluate its bullish sentiment.     Given the low base, the company's performance in the quarter was muted, especially when compared to the preceding March quarter. Revenues grew 17%, lower than the Street expectation of 20% â implying that the Maggi ramp up is likely to be more gradual. Even the non-Maggi portfolio is not estimated to have grown strongly â highlighting the growth concerns present pre-Maggi controversy.     After its re-launch in last November, Maggi noodles has regained market leadership with a 57% share in the segment. Before the ban, Maggi enjoyed nearly 80% share of the instant noodles market.     The Street's irrational exuberance is reflected in the fact that while Maggi has not achieved pre-crisis level of volumes and market share, the stock has crossed its pre-controversy level. It is trading at 40 times its estimated earnings for CY17.     The company's strong brand equity, presence in the promising and under-penetrated food segments and focus on the premium market gives it an enviable position. Under the new management, it has launched 25 new products. It has also been investing in building its capabilities. These measures augur well for the long term-growth. However, the Street would want the company to grow its revenues at a more aggressive pace.
