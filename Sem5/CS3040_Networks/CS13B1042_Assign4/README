This folder contains: ProxyServer.java, ProxyClient.java

1) First compile both java files:- 
javac ProxyServer.java 
javac ProxyClient.java

2) Now run ProxyServer.java

This takes in 3 arguments: i) port number on which proxy server is running, ii) max cache size, iii) address of the nameserver

To run: java ProxyServer <port> <max_cache_size> <nameserver>

Eg: java ProxyServer 9876 10 127.0.1.1

The nameserver can be found out by : cat /etc/resolv.conf

We specify max cache size as cache can contain only these many entries. If we get a new entry, the oldest entry in the cache will be deleted and the latest one will be stored.  

Now, from the terminal give nslookup command

Eg: nslookup -port=9876 google.com localhost

We get the response at the terminal.
