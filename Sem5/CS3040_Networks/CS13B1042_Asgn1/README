The tunable parameters AVERAGE_DELAY and LOSS_RATE can be specified as mentioned in the protocol design document.

RandomGaussian.java is needed because AVERAGE_DELAY is random gaussian distribution.

How to run?

First, compile UDPServer.java, UDPClient.java, RandomGaussian.java (javac UDPServer.java , javac UDPClient.java, javac RandomGaussian.java)

Next run UDPServer.java (java UDPServer 2222) in one tab, then run UDPClient.java (java UDPClient 2222) in another tab. Here 2222 is the port number which is specified as a command line argument. IP Address is localhost which is specified in the code.

Ping statistics will be obtained at the client.
