How to run this program?

Server part contains - Main.java, ConnectionHandler.java, HttpRequest.java, HttpResponse.java

Client part - Httpclient.java

1) First compile all the java files:

javac Main.java, javac ConnectionHandler.java, javac HttpRequest.java, javac HttpResponse.java, javac Httpclient.java


2) Then run the server in one terminal: java Main <port> 
For eg: java Main 9876
Main.java is the main class of Server. It takes in port number as argument. Here, 9876 is the port number.

To test part 1: Go to browser and give localhost:9876/index.html

Browser sends the GET request to my server and the contents of the requested page is displayed in the browser.
index.html contains links to 5 other pages as shown in the screen shot. Each of them when clicked redirects to a new page.

To test part 2

The client program is Httpclient.java

Run the client: java Httpclient <host> <port> <file>

For eg: java Httpclient 172.16.3.242 9876 /index.html

Client takes in three arguments: IP Address of host, port number and the requested file.
