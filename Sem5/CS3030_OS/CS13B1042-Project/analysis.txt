The Scheduling algorithm which has minimum waiting time is considered efficient.

Total of 10 processes

Case 1:
Equal number of I/O and CPU bound processes (5 : 5)

The difference in avg waiting time among the three scheduling algorithms is not that significant with MLFQ being marginally better than default and Priority being the worst.

Case 2: 7 I/O, 3 CPU

There is no significant difference in avg waiting time between MLFQ and Priority with MLFQ being marginally better.

Default performs the worst with avg waiting time being almost double that of other two. 

Case 3: 3 I/O and 7 CPU

Priority performs the best while default is the worst although there is not much difference in waiting time between Priority and MLFQ.

Case 4: Purely I/O (10 I/O)

MLFQ performs the best although difference in waiting time between MLFQ and Default is not significant. Priority performs the worst.

Avg turnaround time for Default is way lesser than the other two.

Case 5: Purely CPU (10 CPU)

MLFQ performs the best and Priority the worst. The difference in waiting time among Priority and default is negligible.
